1,Elon Musk,hi everyone as you can see I'm I'm not just Maga I'm dark Maga um well first of all I want to say what an honor it is to be here and uh you know the the true test of someone’s character is how they behave under Fire and we we we had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot fight fight fight blood coming down the face now America is the home of the brave and there's no true there's no true T Test than courage under fire so that who do you want representing America yeah absolutely and uh I think I think this this this election I think it's the most important election of our lifetime this is this is no ordinary election uh the other side wants to take away your freedom of speech they want to take away your right to bear arms that they want to it's we're where they want to take away your right to vote effectively you got 14 States now that that don't require voter ID Cal California where I used to live um is just just passed a law Banning voter ID for voting h i I still can't believe that’s real so how you supposed to have a good proper election if there's no ID is meaningless and and and and Free Speech free speech is the Bedrock of democracy and if if people don't know what’s what's going on if they don't know the truth how can you how can you make an informed vote you must have free speech in order to have democracy that's why it's the first amendment and the and and the Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment president Trump must win to preserve the Constitution he must win to preserve Democracy in America yes it this this is this is a must-win situation must win so I have I have one one ask for everyone in the audience everyone who watches this video any any everyone in the live stream there this one request it's very important register to vote okay and and get everyone you know and everyone you don't know drag them to register to vote there’s only two days left to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona 48 Hours like text people now now and then make sure they actually do vote if they don't this will be the last election that's my prediction nothing's more important nothing's more important um so get everyone you know everyone so I'm speaking to people out there everyone in the crowd I think is well already convinced but uh for people out there that are watching the video watching the live stream you need to get everyone you know every at at work your friends family tech text groups your social media everything get them to register to vote right now only two days left for Georgia and Arizona only a couple weeks left in Pennsylvania and and if if they're not registered to vote it doesn't matter at that point register to vote I'm being repetitive for a reason okay so nothing is more important um and a lot of people think maybe the vote doesn't count well it does okay it does it matters and this election could be decided by a th000 votes 500 votes could a tiny margin so get everyone you know to register to vote I believe that's swap swap thot.com I believe that's the the site if you and double check that you that your registration is good don't take it for granted um I'm just being repetitive about this point because it is just one takeaway more than anything that will matter is getting those registrations and then and then getting everyone you know to actually vote that is what will decide this election especially in Pennsylvania so so so so thank you and and honestly I you you want to just be a pest just be a pest to everyone you know people on the street everywhere vote vote vote fight fight fight vote vote vote thank you,trump rally butler pennsylvania,2024/10/5,Youtube
2,Elon Musk,I just want to say I love you guys so uh well we've got a lot of great news to talk about today the the Tesla team has done an incredible job of executing over the past year and we have many exciting years ahead of us so uh yeah so with the uh it Tesla master plan part three which admittedly was you know quite technical we wanted to go into a lot of technical depth um so uh you know it was clear that they were what we were saying what was not just um we're not really assertions but that they were backed up with physics and with real data that it's realistic um and and with the mass plan part three we want to basically the goal is to give people hope realistic hope um and maybe hopes even the wrong word but simply to say that that there is a path to a fully sustainable uh global economy that we are on that path that we are accelerating that path and that’s and that so long as we don't get complacent about it it will happen so I'll I'll just I'll kind of rush through a recap of the mass plan part three but the you know some of the Salient points are that it will actually take less energy to go to to go sustainable not more energy uh it's it's actually more and some of these things may sound very obvious but it's it's more energy efficient to go sustainable not less there's and and there's less mining that is required for sustainable any energy economy not more also very important um I I and I heard a question raised about uh Cobalt mining um and you know what we will do a third party audit so so in fact we'll put a webcam on the mine and if anybody sees any children please let us know uh so I I mean I I don't want to go off on a tangent too much on that front but it’s very important to appreciate that most of our battery packs are iron-based um a majority of our battery packs are iron based not Cobalt um and the the and then our other battery packs are nickel based not Cobalt the nickel batteries use a little bit of cobalt as a binder but only a tiny amount in contrast your phones all use 100 Cobalt I recommend complaining to the phone manufacturers but even for the small amount of cobalt that we do use we will make sure six weeks is Sunday that we're that no child labor is being exploited obviously we're a company that cares a lot about doing the right thing and we don't want to delude ourselves or to loot anyone else so yeah okay so again just recapping master plan part three uh it's it's really the point is to say that it is very very doable it is happening uh we need a a three-fold increase in solar and wind  h we need to really somebody's uh 29-fold increase in vehicle stationary and thermal battery production um actually in a nutshell the way to think about sustainability is the the faster we can make uh battery packs the faster we can move to a sustainable energy economy that's the fundamental limiting factor so just grab some water here so yeah this I can't emphasize that point that point enough the the rate of uh of lithium-ion battery production fundamentally decides the rate at which the world transitions to sustainability because the the batteries are needed for all forms of transport and for stationary storage given the intimate nature of of solar and wind power so um so the and we do invite people to critique our analysis uh because you know at any given analysis is going to be to some degree wrong so we that's why we put it out there looking for for critical feedback to say uh well perhaps we've got some things wrong perhaps some things need to be adjusted uh but generally the feedback we've gotten is that actually our analysis is quite accurate um and uh We've not we've not seen uh any rebuttals thus far that would cause us to change our assumptions so it means roughly 240 terawatt hours of battery pack or 240 000 gigawatt hours of battery need to be produced but it'll only take 0.2 percent of land area for solar and wind so it's a very it's not like we need to carpet the Earth to a solar uh and when it's just literally a fraction of a percent um roughly a 10 trillion dollar manufacturing investment which relative to the global economy is actually a small a small number um yeah roughly roughly 10 percent of the world economy I think obviously I think attempts in the world economy is a small price to pay for a sustainable energy future it's also true that even when factoring in the cost or the the emissions required to produce an electric vehicle which for now are a little higher than gasoline vehicles when you look at the emissions over time electric vehicles absolutely win by a long shot and as as we're seeing the the the cost and the emissions required to produce an electric vehicle are dropping rapidly over time um and we're going to get we're going to get to the point where an electric vehicle is lower is cheaper than a gasoline vehicle so so in in 2022 we avoided releasing about 13 million tons of CO2 reduced uh manufacturing ghg per vehicle by 30 and reduced water usage uh by by 15 uh despite uh massive increases in output so I mean we also made our factories safer which is really important so we track the the injuries per person um and uh we believe at this point we are best in industry or have the lowest uh injuries per person so we're now actually quite a big company from a headcount standpoint this is this is a our direct uh employment number so this does not count contractors and for every uh manufacturing job depending on on how you count it there are at least five uh sometimes up to 10 jobs created uh because you've got to look at the total supply chain as well as the all of the support functions so you know when you create a factory like this you actually create jobs for teachers lawyers Carpenters electricians and and restaurants and and everything  hat’s that's required to support a person at a factory and this is why countries and and states are so interested in having uh manufacturing facilities in their location so anyways it's it's a lot of people gainfully employed doing doing very useful things uh we received a 3.6 million job applications uh last year so uh and um and and once again the uh the top two most desired companies uh for engineers um on Earth uh were SpaceX and Tesla so you know at the end of the day the competitiveness of Any Given company is a function of what where are the most talented people interested in working that that is the team that's going to win in fact if I'd say this is General generally the case if you look at any given company and say where are the most smartest most driven people going to work that company is going to win so whether it's Tesla or any other company we're also excited to announce our next-gen Drive Unit um which is a big reduction in silicon carbide it's half the factory space uh notably there are zero Rare Earth elements required so yeah and we're also changing to a 40 volt 48 volt low voltage architecture in the in the car so uh for yeah this is a big deal actually um so the uh cars have been operating with 12 volt batteries for basically about a century so for the first time in I think over a hundred years uh we're actually going to change from 12 volt uh voltage of you know outside of the drivetrain to a 48 volt uh architecture and to First approximation that that means we need only about a quarter as much copper for uh in the in the car as would be needed for a 12 volt battery so that's a big deal because people often worried about you know is there enough copper yes there is so um and FSD beta is growing uh hyper exponentially so that that chart is going to look like a wall basically um and just a question for for those in the room are you uh have how many people have tried out FSD beta great so so what what do you think of the latest build right so it's um it's really getting to the point where it's uh at least for me when I drive around it's a several days between interventions um and I think we're we're getting to the point where um that there's really just one last piece of of the system that needs to be a neural net which is the the planning and Control Function um and and so we expect to have that last piece become neural net so it'll be end to end from a video in to control out as a neural net um and yeah so the thing the thing to appreciate is it's it's not that uh full self-driving will be as good as a person it will be much much better like a lot like over time and uh 10 times more is 10 times safer than a person it's not even going to be a contest frankly um so this is this is a really big deal um and I think some people realize that I think you guys probably realize it but uh being able to do a software update and have several million cars suddenly go from manual driving to autonomous I think will be the single biggest asset value increase in history um so the normal usage of a passenger car is is called roughly 10 to 12 hours per week call it and maybe an hour and a half per day and when you drive around you see lots of cars just parked in parking lots because out of the 168 hours in a week they're using less than less than 10 percent maybe seven percent of the hours of the week a car is the news but once it is autonomous it can be used probably I don't know 50 50 hours a week maybe more so it's it it if it is effectively a five-fold increase in the value of a car overnight um I'm actually surprised that so few people uh realize this or maybe they just don't believe it it's real um but uh but it is so this is this is really an insanely big deal uh we're also the the largest ev maker in the world um so yeah and I think that will continue um and while at the same time being the highest margin uh of any car maker in the world [Applause] and now making electric vehicles profitably is is hard as illustrated by the difficulty of our competitors a number of a number of our competitors are making EVS at a significant loss um so but we are not we are actually making EVS profitably um and almost no one else is this is hard so um and I'd say for this is It's a massive credit to the Tesla team for I I can’t tell you how hard manufacturing is like you've probably heard me say that prototypes are easy manufacturing is hard um and then and then manufacturing at scale with positive cash flow is excruciating this is Mega pain um but the Tesla team has done it so and as you can see our free cash flow per year has been increasing steadily so you know we're making good progress um I mean it it should be said that uh and I've made some of these comments um that the the that interest rates make a very big have a very big effect on the affordability of cars so the vast majority of people buy cars based on the monthly payment so it’s like how much money how much is monthly payment um and it's it's not a it's not a question of of value for money it's just do they actually have enough money can they afford it um so people so for the vast majority of people is just can they afford to pay the payment as the interest rates increase and credit Titans um like it's safe to say that the you know these various banks that um have died are probably uh somewhat distracted um from handing out Auto loads you know it's like if they're on the way to the cemetery increasing their auto loan portfolio is not the first thing on their mind um so this is going to be a challenging I'd say a challenging 12 months I want to be sort of realistic about it that Tesla is not immune to the global economic environment I expect things to be just at a macroeconomic level um difficult for at least the next 12 months like Tesla will get through it and we'll do well and I think we'll see a lot of companies actually go bankrupt so I I want to make sure that this is not just the good news parade it's important to to understand that no company is immune to the macroeconomic environment but that said the it won't be Darkness forever I expect probably a year of difficulty uh globally for everyone um and then my my best guess is that the global economy turns around uh in roughly 12 months um and and then Tesla will be in an extremely good position so anyone who is a long-term investor I think will do extremely well and um here I want to give a big shout out to the Tesla internal software uh Team this is um it's actually a a really big deal that uh Tesla has such a powerful internal software team um I mean that that software team is responsible for handing the entire uh customer experience from from buying the car delivering the car uh operating the factories um service and support uh we internally wrote all of the Insurance and financial software um the it's or the supply chain and Logistics stuff the data centers the infrastructure um and the analytics Insight this is all uh internally written Tesla software and I think there's there are almost no companies in the world can do this because they do not have uh a very talented internal uh software team so they’re generally reliant on third-party um enterprise resource planning software so but Tesla is not this this is this is a hidden strength of the company um that that often doesn't get a lot of attention but is incredibly powerful so once again I'd like to thank them for their work and uh as predicted um we are highly confident that model y will be the number one best-selling car on Earth this year and in fact in Europe the best-selling car of any kind uh yeah whatsoever it already was that in q1 I should say um it's not like will be it was that in q1 uh and uh China's best-selling SUV um and theUnited States the best-selling uh non-pecup vehicle in the United States and q1 so um you know it's going well uh I don't know if this is like the optimal picture but um the the uh it's uh Tesla cars are actually the the safest cars in the world we put um immense effort into vehicle safety and we keep updating the safety so we keep improving the automatic emergency braking system just with a software update and we keep improving the airbag deployment uh with software updates so we close the feedback loop on like when we see an accident we analyze the accident we say what can we do from a software standpoint because there’s actually quite a lot you can do to first of all avoid the accident because the best accident is no accident um and then if the accident occurs how do we deploy the airbags uh and the the sort of the seat belt pre-tensioners uh to minimize the probability of injury um and uh so even even for cars that people have owned for many years uh we are behind the scenes uh continuously uh improving the safety of of your car and um and there are even some things that I think a lot of people aren't aware of that we we actually have automatic Cavern cabin overheat protection so uh never in the history of the company has a a child or a pet died in a Tesla all right so it's it's one of those like little known features but uh because we have a large battery and we're monitoring things all the time we can make sure that the cabin temperature uh never gets to lethal levels um and uh I think that's that's a yeah big deal so um oh yeah so and then um while lots of cars will say they've got like you know five stars or or whatever um uh there's there's Nuance to that um when we do did the European end cap uh sort of active safety tests uh we got the highest scores that they've ever seen so yeah so we we we got a 98 uh score on the active safety system um which obviously isn't good enough um and we will but we we have got a game plan for uh getting rid of the last two percent that's it and then it's worth noting things like the total cost of ownership of a model 3 is now comparable to that of a Toyota Toyota Corolla so superchargers we're making good progress so our supercharger uptime is now 99.95 percent so yeah and we have supercharges practically everywhere at this point going to mega pack because this is a stationary storage is an important part of solving the sustainable energy problem and to make the the Tesla mega pack is now more competitive than a natural gas speaker plant so we have very strong demand for the Tesla mega pack and uh we're going to make a lot of them so yeah um and a while back I predicted that the Tesla uh stationary battery pack business would actually grow faster than the automotive side of things and that's exactly what has happened uh you can see it's it's an it's an exponential curve uh growing at a rate that that is even faster than our vehicle sales so yeah sorry um we're expanding gigafactory Nevada um for the Tesla semi-production line and for the 4680 in in-house cell production and uh yeah some Mega Factory stuff so this is um so we're aiming for 40 gigawatt hours a year both in California and in China but I think um long term this will be a much much greater than this I mean I would say I wouldn't be surprised if long term uh the stationary battery pack uh activity went uh well in excess of 500 gigawatt hours per year so the the demand is like quite quasi infinite here so um as we look ahead to tackle the what we see as the the choke points in the supply chain one of them is uh lithium refining um and uh I mean there's been a few times on Tesla earnings calls where I’ve said Can someone please just do lithium refining um because uh it's it's there's just a shortage of it um and uh but we we really see very little activity that's outside of China for for lithium refining so um it's not that we wish to take on extra problems but since nobody else was doing it we felt we had to do this and so uh we've just Broken Ground on a lithium Refinery and Corpus Christi which will be um do more lithium refining then I think probably everything outside of China so yeah and we signed a deal for our next gigafactory and in Mexico uh and I I think that's going to be a fantastic Factory so uh you know we're we're laying the groundwork for um ultimately getting to 20 million Vehicles a year so cyber truck is a hard car to make um it's because it's a such a radically new design it actually you can't just use conventional methods of manufacturing we had to invent uh a whole new set of manufacturing techniques in order to build an exoskeleton based car instead of an endoskeleton based car so it’s it's extremely non-trivial to to build the Cyber truck um but we're making good progress on that we have the um so so yes it's a i that that's the the thing I when I uh in the factory I I took the Cyber Truck Line to see how we're doing there and um and uh sorry for delay but we're finally going to start delivering production cyber trucks later this year and I think the product if anything is better than expectations I mean cyber truck is the is the car I will be driving on a day-to-day basis um so and you know people always want to know what our next product is uh but this is not the time to we obviously need to have a you know a proper dedicated product launch um I I just want to emphasize that we are actually building a new product we are actually designing a new product uh we're not sitting on our hands here um so uh there are two new products that I think you will be very excited about and both the design of the products and the manufacturing techniques are Head and Shoulders above anything else that is present in industry so yeah anyways if I were to guess I I would say of these these two new products just these two new products alone I I would say this what we will probably make obviously this is just you know elon's guess um so you know don't sue me um um but uh I I you know elon's guess is that um I that that will probably make in excess of five million units a year of these two models combined so thank you these are all real by the way hahaha but I think the thing um most notable is if you look at the difference between the last time we showed Optimus and and this was a video that was taken basically yesterday and The Optimist team was up all night making this video the Optimus team has done an incredible job so I just yeah and it's uh the the the the motors the controllers um the electronics um and everything you see in the Optimus robot is a tesla-designed uh system so this is we actually try to find um Drive actuators and and whatnot that that were off the shelf we we found that there weren't any um in order to make um and an effective uh humanoid robot you actually have to design the motors and gearboxes and the electronics from scratch because it's a very different application from anything else that exists um so we took our world-class motor and Power Electronics team and uh and say and said okay we need to design several um uh actuators that are that don't exist in the world um and they did so Optimus is is working quite well and then for full self-driving as for self-driving gets closer and closer to generalized real world AI that same software is transferable to a humanoid robot just like um you know we you know humans can obviously walk around with their arms and legs but but we can drive a car fly a plane uh steer a boat ride a horse if you have a generalized understanding or if you have generalized real world AI which is what we are developing for full self-driving it can be transferred to basically anything um and um so so optimists will use the same FSE computer as as the car and um The Optimist stuff is is um I think somewhat not somewhat extremely underrated because people just cannot comprehend the the the consequences now obviously we need to make sure that we don't have a Terminator scenario that's very important uh it's all fun and games until Terminator shows up but uh if you say like if you have had a generalized um humanoid robot what would be the effective ratio of humanoid robots to humans because I think basically everyone would want one and and maybe people would want more than one which means the actual demand for for something like Optimus if it really works um which will uh is uh I I don't know I mean 10 billion units it's it's it's some crazy number um it might be 20 billion units If the ratio is say two to one on people you know humanoid robots versus people it might actually be it's not it's some very big number is what I'm saying um and a number of vastly in excess of the number of cars um so my prediction is that uh Tesla's long-term value uh will be a majority of long-term value will be optimists uh and and that protection I'm very confident of so anyway let's see so I think with that we can do questions perhaps oh okay what is it oh yeah we also want to make sure uh retail investors please please vote uh normally retail investors uh for most companies don't vote but you we really care about your vote um of uh of small investors not just a lot of large investors so please do register to vote um your vote is very important um and uh yeah I think that's yeah that's that's it so um yeah,Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting,2024/6/13,Youtube
3,Elon Musk,"Well, it would be a new frontier and an opportunity to rethink the whole nature of government just as was done in the creation of the United States. I mean, I would suggest having a direct democracy, like people vote directly on things, as opposed to representative democracy. So, representative democracy, I think, is too subject to a special interests and coercion of the politicians and that kind of thing. So I'd recommend that there's just direct democracy. People vote on laws, the population votes on laws themselves, and then the laws must be short enough that people can understand them. Yeah. Absolute transparency. Have to accept cookies. There's always a slight amount of trepidation when you click accept cookies. I feel as though there's perhaps a very tiny chance that'll open a portal to hell or something like that. Why do they keep wanting me to accept that? What do they want with this cookie? Somebody got upset with accepting cookies or something somewhere. I mean, who cares? So annoying to keep accepting all these cookies. Yes you can have my damn cookie, I don't care. Whatever. And stop asking me. It's annoying. Yeah, somebody was like, there's some good intentions of like privacy or whatever, but now everyone's just has to tick accept cookies and it's now, you have billions of people who have to keep clicking accept cookie and it's super annoying. Just accept the damn cookie, it's fine. There is like, I think fundamental problem that we’re, because we've not really had a major, like a world war or something like that in a while. And obviously we would like to not have world wars. There's not been a cleansing function for rules and regulations. So wars did have some silver lining in that there would be a reset on rules and regulations after a war. So World Wars I and II there were huge resets on rules and regulations. If society does not have a war, and there's no cleansing function or garbage collection for rules and regulations, then rules and regulations will accumulate every year 'cause they're immortal. There's no actual, humans die, but the laws don't. So, we need a garbage collection function for rules and regulations that should not just be immortal. 'Cause some of the rules and regulations that are put in place will be counterproductive, done with good intentions, but counterproductive. And sometimes not done with good intentions. If rules and regulations just accumulate every year, and you get more and more of them, then eventually you won't be able to do anything. You're just like Gulliver with, tied down by thousands of little strings. And we see that in, U.S. and LA, basically all economies that have been around for awhile, and regulators and legislators create new rules and regulations every year, but they don't put effort into removing them. And I think that's very important that we put effort into removing rules and regulations. But it gets tough 'cause you get special interests that then are dependent on, they have a vested interest in that whatever rule regulation and that they, then they fight to not get it removed. Yeah, it's from a coding standpoint. Yeah. in Python and so on. - Yeah. So, yeah, something needs to happen or just the civilizations arteries just harden over time. And you can just get less and less done because there's just a rule against everything. So I think, I don't know, for Mars, or whatever, I say, or even for here, obviously for Earth as well, I think there should be an active process for removing rules and regulations and questioning their existence. If we've got a function for creating rules and regulations, 'cause rules and regulations could also think of as like, they're like soft work or lines of code for operating a civilization, that's the rules and regulations. So it's not like we shouldn't have rules and regulations, but you have your code accumulation, but no code removal. And so it just gets to be become basically archaic bloatware after a while. And it's just, it makes it hard for things to progress. So, I don't know, maybe Mars you'd have like any given law must have a sunset, and require active voting to keep it up there. I actually also say like, and these are just, I don't know, recommendations or thoughts, and ultimately will be up to the people on Mars to decide, but I think it should be easier to remove a law than to add one, because of the, just to overcome the inertia of laws. So, maybe it's like, for argument's sake, you need like say 60% vote to have a law take effect, but only a 40% vote to remove it.",Lex Fridman Podcast #252 with Elon Musk_Government on Mars,2021/12/28,Youtube
4,Elon Musk,"um you know a human ai symbiote situation so you'll see it coming you know like when well assuming civilization is still around um it's looking fragile right now um i think we i think we could have a
in 25 years probably something i think like that could be a whole brain interface sorry pretty close to that yeah um like almost all the neurons are connected to uh you're the sort of ai extension of yourself yeah well you like i said you already have a computer extension of yourself in your phone you know and computers and stuff so and now online it's like somebody dies there's this like an online ghost that they're they're still their online stuff it's alive yeah instagram and their stories and stuff whatever facebook inside you know like yeah so  yeah so there's it would just be that that more of you would be in the cloud i guess than in your body more of it more of you what's that i've never heard of it yeah no it's like uh uh sure yeah well yeah i mean this certainly has taken over the mayan space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking yeah um i mean i kind of saw this whole thing play out in china uh before it played out in the us so um it's kind of like watching the same movie again but in english um so yeah um i might i think the the the the mortality rate is much less than what is then what say the world health organization said it was it's very much module assets like probably at least order of magnitude less yeah i mean if you’re you can look at the mortality statistics you know by age and whether they have comorbid comorbidities like do they have like basically existing conditions and um by age um and uh you know if you're below 60 and and have no serious health issues the probability of death is extremely low it's not zero but it’s extremely low it's almost like people really wanted a panic that you know quite quite crazy most of the hospitals in the united states right now half empty in some cases they're at 30 capacity yes i mean we're not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important like it's like and you need a you know triple bypass it's like sort of elective but if you don't get it done in time it's you're gonna die it's yeah elective it's not like hey i i want to it's not like plastic surgery it's more like like my my hip is i'm in extreme pain because my my hips blown out or my knee and i don't want to go to the hospital i can’t go to the hospital to you know people in extreme pain people that need a kidney you know like people that have like quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear um so i think it's it's a problem it's not go it is i mean objectively the mortality is is much lower like at least a factor of 10 maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thoughtwell i think proper hygiene is a good thing no matter what you know wash your hands and you know and if you’re if you're coughing stay home or wear a mask this is not good you know um likethey do that in japan that's like normal if you're if you're ill you you wear a face mask and you don't cough on peoplei think that that would be a great thing to to adopt in general throughout the world um washing your hands is also good that disgusting it's true yeah let's go to the restroom you can see us yes true um so yeah i think that there's definitely some silver linings here than in improved uh you know uh hygiene yes and i think this has shaken up the the system uh system is like somewhat more bond with la la's layers of bureaucracy and i think that we've cut through some of that bureaucracy uh and if we you know at some point there probably will be a uh pandemic with with a with a high mortality rate uh debate about like what's high but i mean like someone that's killing a lot of 20 year olds let's say like it's yeah if you had like ebola type of mortality yeah yeah um yeah but it's a yeah like like killing large numbers of young healthy people that that's you know define that as like uh uh high mortality then that this is at least practice for something like that um and i think there's this you know given it's just a matter of time that there will be eventually some some such pandemic yeah absolutely um and i think i think there's a good chance it's highly likely i think coming out of this that we will develop uh vaccines that we didn't have before uh for uh coronaviruses and other other viruses um and and possibly cures uh for for these and our understanding of uh viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it's received so there's definitely some you know a lot of silver linings here um and yeah yeah yeah there's uh i think there will be some amounts of lighting here no matter what um hopefully it can be more professive lighting than less um so yeah this is this is uh it's like kind of like a practice run for something that had that that had a potential that might in the future have a serious uh like a really high mortality rate that and we kind of got to go through this with without without it being something that kills you know vast numbers of young healthy people that is the exact wording well i mean i certainly get that there’s no shortage of negative feedback on twitter you know warzone yeah i mean scroll through the comments like as a meme warzone i mean people knife you good on twitter sure i mean i've been in the twitter war zone for for a while here so you know take it takes a lot to phase me yeah you can't take it personally these people don't like actually know you you know like yeahit's just like you know so it's like if you're if you're fighting a war and there's like some opposing soldier that that shoots shoots at you it's not like they hate you they don't even know you so just think of it like that like they're firing bullets or whatever um but they don't know you so don't take it personally well there'll always be some ambiguity but tweets are it's hard um like the maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something you know um or i'm not you know just kidding or whatever you know like don’t yeah wow that's amazing sure uh yeah i know it's pretty great it might be the best news source is this like like a female avatar okay okay sure sure sure i find twitter quite engaging um well i mean it's like five minutes every couple hours type of thing it's not like i'm sitting on the whole day yeah you have to you know like i said take a certain amount of distance from you read this and you're like okay it's bullets being fired by an opposing army you know don't like it it's not like they they like so it's not like they know you it's like don't take it personally um yeah that was annoying it was wrong yeah i don't think cnn is that used to be yeah um like what do you think's the the best source of just like information out there you know like let's say you're just like average citizen trying to just get the facts you know figure out what's going on like you know how to live your life and you know just looking for what what's going on in the world that it's hard to find something that that isn't you know that's that that's good you know uh that you know not not trying to push some partisan angle not trying to not not sort of doing sloppy reporting and and just aiming for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing you're just trying to figure out what's going on it's like i'm hard pressed where do you go exactly sure i think like maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and yeah kind of falling down as opposed to the publication okay tall right i'll check it out wow that's nice yeah um yeah  yeah yeah i mean i in general i think that's like we should be concerned about um anything that's a massive infringement on our civil civil liberties you know so it's like you got to put a lot of weight on that um you know people a lot of people died to you know win independence with the country and and fight for the democracy that we have and uh you know we should treasure that and not and not give up our liberties too easily i think we've we i mean i think we probably did that actually fundamentally a violation of the constitution freedom of assembly and you know it's just i mean i don't think these things stand up in court really yeah yeah yeah these these are these would definitely not stand up uh you know if the supreme court here i mean it's obviously a complete violation right yeah yeah i mean it it it just should be if if you're if you're at risk you should not be compelled to leave your house um or leave a place of safety but you should also not be uh if you're not at risk or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life you should have the right to do that yes i mean there's there's a strong a strong downside to this so yeah i just believe like you know if this is a free country you should be you know a lot allowed to do you know what you want as long as it does not endanger others yeah um as i said right yeah my opinion is if if somebody wants to stay home they should stay home and say something doesn't want to stay home they should not be compelled to stay home that's my opinion if somebody doesn't like that well that's my opinion um so the now yeah um the the this notion though that uh you know you can just sort of send checks out everybody and and things will be fine it's not true obviously um the there's some people have this absurd like a view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty like it it just makes stuff stuff you know whatever it just there's a magic quarter plenty and the goods and services they just come from this magic horn of plenty and then if um like if somebody has more stuff than somebody else's because they took more from this magic horn of plenty now let me uh just break it to uh the fools out there if you don't make stuff there's no stuff yeah so if you don't make the food if you don't process the food you know transport the food and what the whether you know medical treatment getting getting your teeth fixed there's no stuff i become detached from reality you can't just legislate money and solve these things if you don't make stuff there is no stuff obviously we'll run out of the stores run out of the you know it's the whole the machine just grinds to a halt maybe i think briefly briefly but uh i think if you know any any kind of like sensible examination of what happened in china would lead to the conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur uh this this virus originated in wuhan there's like i don't know hundred thousand people a day leaving on uh so it that that it it uh it went everywhere very fast through throughout china throughout the rest of the world um and the fatality rate was was low sure what the thing is that american companies have massive supply chains in china like tesla for example we have hundreds of suppliers like tier one two three four suppliers throughout throughout china so weknow if they are able to make stuff or not we know if they if they have issues or not then they they're china is back back at full steam um and until many uh pretty much every u.s company has some significant number of spies in china so you know you know if they're able to you know provide things or not or if there's you know high mortality rate tesla has seven thousand people in china so zero people died zero yeah yeah yeah we literally we're in payroll this same folks are there yeah i i think there has been some politician this has been politicized you know in both directions really so it’s um which is not great yeah but like i said separate apart from that i think there's the question of like you know where do several civil liberties fit in this picture you know and uh what what what can the government make you do what can they make you not do and what you know what’s what's okay um and uh yeah i think we went too far absolutely well i think we're we're rapidly moving towards opening up the country um it's going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks so yeah something that would be helpful just add from an informational level is um when reporting uh sort of covid cases to separate out diagnosed with covid versus uh had covid like symptoms because the list of symptoms that could be covered at this point is like a mile long so it's like a hard to if you're ill at all it's like it could be covid so just just to give people better information definitely diagnosed with covid or had covid like symptoms we're conflating those two so that one that it looks bigger than it is then uh if somebody dies is was covid a a primary cause of the death or not uh i mean if i mean if somebody has covid gets eaten by a shark we find their arm their arm has covid it's gonna get recorded as a covid death basically you get hit by a bus if you if you get hit by a bus go to the go to the hospital and die and then find that you have covid you will be recorded as a covid death well right now the so you know the road is hell is paved with good intentions i mean he's mostly paid with bad intentions but there's you know some good intentions saving stones in there too um and the the the stimulus bill that was intended ",The Joe Rogan Experience,7/5/2020,Youtube
5,Elon Musk,"there are 8 billion on people on Earth and it would be better if there were none yeah I'm like hey buddy you can start with yourself you know if you really want to you know make a difference I about to you know take your own advice here um but but that that’s like a crazy Viewpoint you know that’s like literally saying let's genocide Humanity I'm like what how can you say that with a straight face that's like total Madness um but but people like like I said in the limit of environment of environmentalism it sort of becomes like an ingrown toenail you know it’s sort of like yeah toenail is fine but not if it's like warped and ingrown it’s it's just gone too far um humanity is not a light on on the face of the Earth and frankly even with climate change uh life on Earth will still continue um I mean the calamities that Earth has suffered where life continued afterwards like gigantic meteorite impact super volcanoes the continent drifting all over the place uh there've been times in Earth's past where it's been like a total snowball or it's been absolutely sweltering hot and um you know life you know we had extin many Extinction events but there were uh life continued um but um you like we we don't see the dinosaurs now but they've had a good run for what over 100 plus million years MH um so uh so even if there's catastrophic climate change on Earth life continues um just may not be the Life as we know it it'll it may not be humans it be something else um so what we're talking about with climate change is not a threat to all life on Earth but really maybe a threat to human humans or and dislocation of humans if there's lowline countries that um you know the water level rises and now they're underwater 
type of thing so um so like I mean I think one just needs to strike the right balance by saying like look over time we need to move to a sustainable energy economy and we we can't just keep taking billions of tons 
of carbon from deep underground and putting it in the atmosphere and expect nothing will happen forever yeah um but we also don't need to be alarmist about it and super negative and massively disrupt people's Lifestyles I mean I think people can continue to live a normal life and and they shouldn't be guilty about being human or sort of frankly having a steak it's fine yeah I I mean I agree with that 
I mean I agree with what you just said but I also think that the cost of sustainable energy has been dropp dropping tremendously and you're seeing um a lot more uh wind and solar um and uh you know pair that with a the battery and you've got uh you know continuous power from wind wind and solar uh that’s actually very competitive so cost competitive um and um actually one of the one of the nice things about say solar battery is you you don't need to run high power lines all over the place you can have some you know localized uh solar battery situation on your house or um Factory building or it's you can kind of decentralize the power generation it's a and and I think that's actually better for people to have decentralized power generation um and uh also decentralized Communications um like a lot of places they skipped all the sort of phone landline stuff and went to cell phones yes in fact a lot of places um in the world have way better cell connectivity than you know Silicon Valley which is bizarre yeah",Zuby Podcast Ep. 263,2023/10/24,Youtube
6,Elon Musk,"First of all, I'd like to say, Your Highness, Your Excellencies, and distinguished guests, thank you very much for hosting me virtually. It's an honor to be here or be there virtually. I actually wish I could be there in person. With respect to the Twitter transaction, there's a limit to what I can say publicly given that it is somewhat of a sensitive matter. I would like to be measured in my responses here, such as not to generate incremental lawsuits. Yes. Deposition minimization is I think important. Well, there are still a few unresolved matters. You've probably read about the question as to whether
the number of fake and spam users on the system is less than 5% as for claims, which I think is probably not most people’s experience when using Twitter. We're still awaiting resolution on that matter, and that is a very significant matter. We're awaiting resolution on that. Then, of course, there is the question of, will the debt portion of the round come together, and then will the shareholders vote in favor? I think those are the three things that needs to be resolved before the transaction can complete. I think a recession is inevitable at some point. As to whether there is a recession in the near term, I think that is more likely than not. It's not a certainty, but it appears more likely than not. What do you think? Twitter does not operate in China. I think China does not attempt to interfere with the free speech of the press in the US, as far as I know. I assume you're not under pressure at Bloomberg from China. I don't think this is going to be an issue.My aspiration for Twitter or in general for the digital town square would be that it is as inclusive in the broader sense of the word as possible, that it is an appealing system to use. Ideally, I'd like to get like 80% of North America, and perhaps I don't know half the world or something ultimately on Twitter in one form or another. That means it must be something that is appealing to people. It obviously cannot be a place where they feel uncomfortable or harassed or they'll simply not use it. I think there's this big difference between freedom of speech and freedom of reach in that one can obviously, let's say in the United States go in the middle of Times Square and pretty much yell anything you want. You'll annoy the people around you, but you're allowed to just yell whatever you want in a crowded public place, more or less apart from, ""This is a robbery.” Probably that would get you in trouble but then that whatever you say, have a controversial does not need to then be broadcasted to the whole country. I think generally the approach of Twitter should be to let people say what they want to do within the bounds of the law but then limit who sees that based on any given Twitter user preferences. If your preferences are to see anything or read anything, then, you'll get that but if your preferences are you prefer not to see comments that you find offensive in one form or another, then you can have that as a setting and not see it but I think one way or another one needs to take the steps that entice most people to want to be on Twitter and enjoy it and find it informative and entertaining and funny and useful. As useful as possible. Well, I would drive the product which is what I do at SpaceX and Tesla. I drive the product in technology. Whether I'm called the CEO or something else is much less important than my ability to drive the product in the right direction. I believe that forecast was from you, I would not agree with that forecast, no. I'd say that I am very impressed with the car companies in China, just in general. With companies in China, I think they're extremely competitive, hard-working, and smart. I think there's going to be just a massive wave of Chinese products going out into the world. They already are. For example, almost all the iPhones are made in China by contract manufacturers for Apple. I think we'll see just a large wave of products being exported from China in many industries. I should say, from a Tesla perspective, we don't really think about other competitors. Our constraints are much more in raw materials and being able to scale up production. Our constraints are not imposed upon us by competitors but rather just imposed upon us by the realities of the supply chain and building up our manufacturing capacity. As anyone knows, who has tried to order a Tesla, the demand for our cars is extremely high, and the wait list is long. This is not intentional. We're increasing production capacity as fast as humanly possible. We really don't think about competition at all. We just think about how do we address the limiting factors in the supply chain and in our own industrial capacity. Basically, we need to build the factories faster and that we need to look ahead to whatever the choke points are in the whole lithium-ion battery, supply chain from mining and refining to cathode and anode production and cell formation. Tesla is reducing the salaried workforce by roughly 10% over the next probably three months or so. We expect to grow our hourly workforce. I was quite clear that we expect to grow our hourly workforce but we grew very fast on the salaried side and we grew a little too fast in some areas, and so it requires a reduction in the salaried workforce. We're about two-thirds hourly and one-third salary. I guess, technically, attempts at reduction in the salaried workforce is only roughly at 3%, 3.5% reduction in total headcount. We did make an announcement. Let’s not read too much into a pre-emptive lawsuit that has no standing. That is just a small lawsuit of minor cost points, that just anything that's related to Tesla gets big headlines whether it is a bicycle accident or something much more serious. It seems like anything which is related to Tesla gets a lot of clicks whether it is trivial or significant. I would put that lawsuit you're referring to in the trivial category. A year from now, I think our headcount will be higher in both salaried and obviously in hourly, but in the short-term of the next few months, we expect to see, like I said, roughly a 10% reduction in salaried workforce which is actually just really only 3%, 3.5% reduction in total headcount and not super material. Well, I was recently asked if I had decided on who I would be supporting in the next presidential race and I said I had not decided who I would support. Then I was asked, ""Well, who might you be leaning towards?” I said, ""Possibly, DeSantis.” I think I'm undecided at this point on that election. Yes. I have not decided on an amount, but it would be some nontrivial figure I think. At least on the order Sorry. I don't know, I've not decided on the exact amount, but perhaps it'd be $20 or $25 million. Well, no, I don't think so. I have never said that people should invest in crypto. In the case of Tesla, SpaceX, and myself all did buy some Bitcoin but it's a small percentage of our total cash or near cash assets, not less significant. I also bought some dogecoin and Tesla accepts dogecoin for some merchandise and SpaceX will the same. I intend to personally support a dogecoin because I just know a lot of people who are not that wealthy, who have encouraged me to buy and support dogecoin. I'm responding to those people. Just people that when I've walked around the factory it's SpaceX or Tesla, they've asked me to support dogecoin so I'm doing so. I said I support dogecoin and I am doing that. Well, I hope that we will have an interesting prototype to show people. We have a very talented team at Tesla that I'm working with closely to have a prototype humanoid robot ready by the end of September. I think we are tracking to that point and there'll be a few other exciting things that we talk about at the Tesla AI day. We have these AI day events to just emphasize that Tesla is a lot more than a car company and that we are in my view, the leading real-world AI company that exists. I think we should be concerned about AI and I said for a long time there I think there ought to be an AI regulatory agency that oversees artificial intelligence for the public good. For anything whether is a risk to the public, whether that's food and drug administration or federal aviation administration, federal communications commission, whether it's a public risk or public good at stake, it is good to have a government referee and a regulatory body. I think we should have that for AI, we don't currently and that would be my recommendation. You're most welcome. Thanks for having me. Bye.",Qatar Economic Forum,2022/6/21,Youtube
7,Elon Musk,"Drinking coffee or water? I mean, sure. This supposed to keep you up till like tomorrow afternoon basically. So what is Nitro? It's just got a lot of caffeine or something? It's got nitrogen, that's ridiculous. I mean, what we breathe is 78% nitrogen anyway. What do you need to add more for? Most people think that they're breathing oxygen, and they're actually breathing 78% nitrogen. You need like a milk bar. Like from Clockwork Orange. Clockwork Orange, it's pretty good. I mean, it's demented. Jarring, I'd say. Oh, thanks, yeah. Yeah, and we just, obviously, our second implant as well. So far so good.  It looks like we got um I think over 400 electrodes that are providing signals. So yeah.  It depends on the regulatory approval, the rate which we get regulatory approvals. So we're hoping to do 10 by the end of this year. Total of 10, so eight more. I mean, I don't wanna jinx it, but it seems to have gone extremely well with the second implant, so there's a lot of signal, a lot of electrodes. It's working very well. I mean, in years, it's gonna be gigantic, because we'll increase the number of electrodes dramatically. We'll improve the signal processing. Even with only roughly, I don't know, 10, 15% of the electrodes working with Noland, with our first patient, we were able to get to achieve a bit per second. That's twice the world record. So I think we'll start like vastly exceeding world record by orders of magnitude in the years to come. So it's start getting to, I don't know, a hundred bits per second thousand. Maybe if like five years from now, we might be at a megabit, like faster than any human could possibly communicate by typing or speaking. Telepathy Yeah. And with humans.Provided they have they want a Neuralink too. Otherwise, they won't be able to absorb the signals fast enough. Well, I think you could think of it, if you were to slow down communication, how do you feel about that? If you'd only talk at, let's say, 1/10th of normal speed, you'd be like, ""Wow, that's agonizingly slow."" So now, imagine you could speak, communicate clearly at 10 or 100 or 1,000 times faster than normal.  I usually default to 1.5x. You can do 2x, but well, actually, if I'm listening to somebody in like sort of 15, 20 minutes segments to go to sleep, then I'll do it 1.5x. If I'm paying attention, I'll do 2x. But actually, if you start actually listen to podcasts or sort of audio books or anything, if you get used to doing it at 1.5, then one sounds painfully slow. Well, depends on the person. You can speak very fast. Like we can communicate very quickly. And also, if you use a wide range of, if your vocabulary is larger, your bit rate, effective bit rate is higher. Yeah. If there's a single word that is able to convey something that would normally require, I don't know, 10 simple words, then you've got maybe a 10x compression on your hands. And that's really, like with memes, memes are like data compression. It conveys a whole, you're simultaneously hit with a wide range of symbols that you can interpret. And you kinda get it faster than if it were words or a simple picture. Yeah. There's an entire idea structure that is like an idea template, and then you can add something to that idea template. But somebody has that preexisting idea template in their head. So when you add that incremental bit of information, you're conveying much more than a few, just set a few words. It's everything associated with that meme.  Yes. Yeah, I mean certainly, if you're anywhere at 10,000 bits per second, I mean, that's vastly faster than any human could communicate right now. If you think about what is the average bits per second of a human? It is less than one bit per second over the course of a day, because there are 86,400 seconds in a day. And you don't communicate 86,400 tokens in a day. Therefore, your bits per second is less than one, averaged over 24 hours. It's quite slow. And now, even if you're communicating very quickly, and you're talking to somebody who understands what you're saying, because in order to communicate, you have to at least, to some degree, model the mind state of the person to whom you're speaking. Then take the concept you're trying to convey, compress that into a small number of syllables, speak them, and hope that the other person decompresses them into a conceptual structure that is as close to what you have in your mind as possible. Yeah, very lousy compression and decompression. And a lot of what your neurons are doing is distilling the concepts down to a small number of symbols of, say, syllables that I'm speaking, or keystrokes, whatever the case may be. So that's a lot of what your brain computation is doing. Now, there is an argument that that's actually a healthy thing to do or a helpful thing to do because as you try to compress complex concepts, you're perhaps forced to distill what is most essential in those concepts as opposed to just all the fluff. So in the process of compression, you distill things down to what matters the most, because you can only say a few things. So that is perhaps helpful. I think we might, we'll probably get, if our data rate increases, it's highly probable that we'll become far more verbose. Just like your computer, when computers had like, my first computer had 8K of RAM, so you really thought about every byte. And now you've got computers with many gigabytes of RAM. So if you wanna do an iPhone app that just says 'Hello world,' it's probably, I don't know, several megabytes minimum. A bunch of fluff. But nonetheless, we still prefer to have the computer with more memory and more compute. So the long-term aspiration of Neuralink is to improve the AI human symbiosis by increasing the bandwidth of the communication, because even in the most benign scenario of AI, you have to consider that the AI is simply gonna get bored waiting for you to spit out a few words. I mean, if the AI can communicate it to terabits per second and you're communicating it bits per second, it's like 203. I think there is some argument for humans as a source of will. Will, yeah. Source of will or purpose. So if you consider the human mind as being essentially, there's the primitive limbic elements, which basically even like reptiles have, and there's the cortex, that's the thinking and planning part of the brain. Now, the cortex is much smarter than the limbic system, and yet is largely in service to the limbic system. It's trying to make the limbic system happy. I mean, the sheer amount of compute that's gone into people trying to get laid is insane, without actually seeking procreation. They're just literally trying to do this sort of simple motion. And they get a kick out of it. So this simple, which in the abstract rather absurd motion, which is sex, the cortex is putting a massive amount of compute into trying to figure out how to do that. Large percent, yeah, yeah. There's no purpose to most sex except hedonistic. It's just sort of joy or whatever. Dopamine release. Now, once in a while, it's procreation, but for humans, modern humans, it's mostly recreational. So your cortex, much smarter than your limbic system, is trying to make the limbic system happy 'cause the limbic system wants to have sex, or want some tasty food or whatever the case may be. And then that is then further augmented by the tertiary system, which is your phone, your laptop, iPad, whatever, or your computing stuff. That's your tertiary layer. So you're actually already a cyborg. You have this tertiary compute layer, which is in the form of your computer with all the applications or your compute devices. And so in the getting laid front, there's actually a massive amount of digital compute also trying to get laid, with like Tinder and whatever. Yeah, I mean, there's like gigawatts of compute going into getting laid, of digital compute. This is happening as we speak.  Pretty much. Well, that's one of the things, certainly, yeah. But what I'm saying is that yes, is there a use for humans? Well, there's this fundamental question of what's the meaning of life? Why do anything at all? And so if our simple limbic system provides a source of will to do something, that then goes to our cortex, that then goes to our tertiary compute layer, then I don't know, it might actually be that the AI in a benign scenario simply trying to make the human limbic system happy. That's limbic too, I think. Not everybody does, but yeah, sure. Some people do. Yeah, I mean, there are these sort of fairly cerebral or kind of higher level goals. I mean, for me it's like, what's the meaning of life, or understanding the nature of the universe is of great interest to me. And hopefully, to AI. And that's the mission of xAI and Grok is understand the universe. Well, assuming there are not, I mean, they're solving basic neurological issues that people have if they've got damaged neurons in their spinal cord or neck or, you know, as is the case with the first two patients, then there's obviously, the first order of business is solving fundamental neuron damage in a spinal cord, neck, or in the brain itself. A second product is called Blindsight, which is to enable people who are completely blind, lost both eyes or optic nerve, or just can't see at all to be able to see by directly triggering the neurons in the visual cortex. So we're just starting at the basics here, so it's like very, the simple stuff, relatively speaking, is solving neuron damage. It can also solve I think probably schizophrenia If people have seizures of some kind, it could probably solve that. It could help with memory. There's like a kind of a tech tree, if you will, of like you got the basics. Like you need literacy before you can have ""Lord of the Rings."" Do you have letters and alphabet? Okay, great. Words? Then eventually get soggy. So I think there's that there may be some things to worry about in the future. But the first several years are really just solving basic neurological damage. Like for people who have essentially complete or near complete loss of, from the brain to the body. Like Stephen Hawking would be an example. The Neuralink would be incredibly profound, cause I mean, you can imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate as fast as we're communicating, perhaps faster. And that's certainly possible. Probable, in fact, likely I'd say. The logical thing to do is, sensible thing to do is to start off solving basic neuron damage issues. 'Cause there's obviously some risk with a new device. You can't get the risk down at zero. It's not possible. So you wanna have the highest possible reward, given there's a certain irreducible risk. And if somebody's able to have a profound improvement in their communication, that's worth the risk. Yeah, as you get the risk down. Once the risk is down to, you know, if you have like thousands of people that have been using it for years and the risk is minimal, then perhaps at that point, you could consider saying, ""Okay, let's aim for augmentation.""  Now, I think we're actually gonna aim for augmentation with people who have neuron damage. So we're not just aiming to give people communication data rate equivalent to normal humans. We're aiming to give people who have quadriplegic or maybe have complete loss of the connection to the brain and body, a communication data rate that exceeds normal humans, going, ""Well, we're in there. Why not? Let's give people superpowers."" Yeah, at first, the vision restoration will be low res, 'cause you have to say like, ""How many neurons can you put in there and trigger? And you can do things where you adjust the electric field to like, even if you've got, say, 10,000 neurons, it's not just 10,000 pixels because you can adjust the feel between the neurons and do them in patterns in order to get, so have, say, 10,000 electrodes effectively give you, I don't know, maybe like having a megapixel or a 10 megapixel situation. And then over time, I think you get to higher resolution than human eyes. And you could also see in different wavelengths. So like Geordi La Forge from ""Star Trek."" Like the thing.  You wanna see in radar? No problem. You could see ultraviolet, infrared, eagle vision, whatever you want.
Is that a Rogan question? Well, I guess, technically it is. Okay. But wait, wait, yeah. Have you said much about it? The ayahuasca? Okay, well, why are you spilling the beans? Turn the tables on you. You're in the jungle. Yeah it must have been crazy. I mean. Things are gonna look pretty wild. Just don't go hugging an anaconda or something. Snakes and ladders.  Okay. Damn. Okay, that sounds like a lot. Of course, is Noland's one cup or You went, wait. Like right off the bat, or did you work your way up to it? You're just jumping at the deep end. Okay. It wasn't like revelation. Okay. It's nine cups. You went to Pluto, I think. Deep space. That's what people. That's what everyone says. Yeah, exactly. Oh, just pure soul. Okay. That's cool. Sure. That sounds awesome. When's Steven coming? Space travel to where? Did you go past the Milky Way? Okay. You're like intergalactic. Okay. Is there aliens? Zero aliens? Sounds good. ""Puff, the Magic Dragon."" Yeah. I mean, the jungle's kinda scary. Sure, okay.  And you're way out in the jungle? Like 10 miles outside of a Rio or something? Deep in the Amazon. Wow, cool.  Probably, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, Neuralink is, it's really a generalized input-output device. It's reading electrical signals and generating electrical signals. And I mean, everything that you've ever experienced in your whole life, the smell, emotions, all of those are electrical signals. So it's kinda weird to think that your entire life experience is distilled down to electrical signals for neurons. But that is in fact the case. Or I mean, that's at least what all the evidence points to. So I mean, if you trigger the right neuron, you could trigger a particular scent. You could certainly make things glow. I mean, do pretty much anything. I mean, really, you can think of the brain as a biological computer. So if there are certain, say, chips or elements of that biological computer that are broken, let's say your ability to, if you've got a stroke, that if you've had a stroke, that means you got, some part of your brain is damaged. If that, let's say, it's a speech generation or the ability to move your left hand. That's the kind of thing that a Neuralink could solve. If you've got like a massive amount of memory loss that's just gone, well, we can't get the memories back. We could restore your ability to make memories, but we can't restore memories that are fully gone.  Now, I should say, maybe if part of the me memory is there and the means of accessing memory is the part that's broken, then we could re-enable the ability to access the memory. But you can think of it like RAM in a computer. If the RAM is destroyed or your SD card is destroyed, we can't get that back. But if the connection to the SD card is destroyed, we can fix that. If it is fixable physically, then yeah, then it can be fixed. Yeah, you could say like, ""Create the most probable set of memories based on all information you have about that person."" You could then, it would be probabilistic restoration of memory. Now, we're getting pretty esoteric here. Yeah, well, I mean, what are we but our memories? And what is death but the loss of memory loss of information? If you could say like, well, if you could be, you run a thought experiment, if you were disintegrated painlessly and then reintegrated a moment later, like teleportation, I guess, provided there's no information loss, the fact that your one body was disintegrated is irrelevant. Death is fundamentally the loss of information, the loss of memory. Yeah. It's an idea that may help with AI safety. Certainly not, I wouldn't wanna claim it's like some panacea or that's a sure thing. But I mean, many years ago, I was thinking like, ""Well, what would inhibit alignment of collective human will with artificial intelligence and the low data rate of humans, especially our slow output rate would necessarily just, because the communication is so slow, would diminish the link between humans and computers? Like the more you are a tree, the less you know what a tree is. Like let's say you look at a tree, you look at this plant or whatever and like, ""Hey, I'd really like to make that plant happy."" But it's not saying a lot, you know? Yeah. We could better align collective human will with AI if the output rate especially was dramatically increased. And I think there's potential to increase the output rate by, I don't know, three, maybe six, maybe more orders of magnitude. So it's better than the current situation.  Yeah. Yeah, I do. Yeah, if it's extremely safe and you can have superhuman abilities, and let's say you can upload your memories, so you wouldn't lose memories, then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it. It would supersede the cell phone, for example. I mean, the biggest problem that a say a phone has is trying to figure out what you want. So that's why you've got auto complete and you've got output, which is all the pixels on the screen. But from the perspective of the human, the output is so freaking slow. Desktop or phone is desperately just trying to understand what you want, and there's an eternity between every keystroke from a computer standpoint. Yeah. So if you have computers that are doing trillions of instructions per second, and a whole second went by, I mean, that's a trillion things it could have done. Yeah. It would be something different. I mean, some sort of futuristic sidewalk. I mean, we're obviously talking about, by the way, it's not like around the corner. You ask me what the distant future was like. Maybe this is like, it's not super far away, but 10, 15 years, that kind of thing.Probably less than 10 years. Depends what you wanna do. A thousand bps when?  Well, we feel pretty confident that I think maybe within the next year or two, that someone with a Neuralink implant will be able to outperform a pro gamer. Because the reaction time would be faster.  Yeah, yeah.Yeah. For AI, that means you've gotta have the most powerful training compute, and the rate of improvement of training compute has to be faster than everyone else or you will not win. Your AI will be worse.  Well, hopefully, end of this year.  If we're lucky, yeah.  I mean, they won't matter. It's sort of like saying, let's say it's a Formula One race. Like what matters more, the car or the driver? I mean, they both matter. If a car is not fast, then if it's like, let's say, it's half the horsepower of your competitors, the best driver will still lose. If it's twice the horsepower, then probably even a mediocre driver will still win. So the training compute is kinda like the engine, how many is this horsepower of the engine. So really, you wanna try to do the best on that. Then how efficiently do you use that training compute? And how efficiently do you do the inference, the use of the AI? So obviously, that comes down to human talent. And then what unique access to data do you have? That also plays a role.  Yeah, I mean, I think, I think most of the leading AI companies have already scraped all the Twitter data. Not I think they have. So on a go forward basis, what's useful is the fact that it's up to the second. That's hard for them to scrape in real time. So there's an immediacy advantage that Grok has already. I think with Tesla and the real time video coming from several million cars, ultimately, tens of millions of cars, with Optimus, there might be hundreds of millions of Optimus robots, maybe billions learning a tremendous amount from the real world. That's the biggest source of data I think ultimately is sort of Optimus. Optimus is gonna be the biggest source of data. 'Cause reality scales. Reality scales to the scale of reality. It's actually humbling to see how little data humans have actually been able to accumulate. Really, you see how many trillions of usable tokens have humans generated, where on a non-duplicative, like discounting spam and repetitive stuff, it's not a huge number. You run out pretty quickly. I mean, except for the store, where I can like pick up the cup and see, did it pick up the cup in the right way? Did it pour water in the cup? Did the water go in the cup or not go in the cup? Did it spill water or not? It's the same as cars, really. I mean, global capacity for vehicles is about a hundred million a year. And it could be higher. It's just that the demand is on the order of a hundred million a year. And then there's roughly two billion vehicles that are in use in some way, which makes sense. Like the life of a vehicle is about 20 years, so it's steady state. You can have a hundred million vehicles produced a year with a two billion vehicle fleet roughly. Now for humanoid robots, the utility is much greater. So my guess is humanoid robots are more like at a billion plus per year. Well, it is. So walk in the park. I mean, Optimus currently would struggle to walk in the park. I mean, it can walk in a park. The park is not too difficult, but it will be able to walk over a wide range of terrain.  Yeah, yeah. It can already do that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's gonna be an immense amount of engineering just going into the hand. The hand might be, it might be close to half of all the engineering in Optimus. From an electromechanical standpoint, the hand is probably roughly half of the engineering. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you start really thinking about your hand and how it works. The sensory control homonculus is where you have humongous hands. So I mean, like your hands, the actuators, the muscles of your hand are almost overwhelmingly in your forearm. So your forearm has the muscles that actually control your hand. There's a few small muscles in the hand itself, but your hand is really like a skeleton meat puppet. And with cables. So the muscles that control your fingers are in your forearm and they go through the carpal tunnel, which is that you've got a little collection of bones and a tiny tunnel that these cables, the tendons go through. And those tendons are mostly what move your hands. Yeah, so like the current Optimus, we tried putting the actuators in the hand itself, but then you sort of end up having these like Yeah, giant hands that look weird. And then they don't actually have enough degrees of freedom and/or enough strength. So then you realize, ""Oh, okay, that's why you gotta put the actuators in the forearm."" And just like a human, you gotta run cables through a narrow tunnel to operate the fingers. And then there's also a reason for not having all the fingers the same length. So it wouldn't be expensive from an energy or evolutionary standpoint to have all your fingers be the same length. So why not do the same length? - Yeah, why not? - Because it's actually better to have different lengths. Your dexterity is better if you've got fingers at different length. There are more things you can do. And your dexterity is actually better if your fingers are a different length. Like there's a reason we've got a little finger. Like why not have little finger this bigger? 'Cause it allows you to do, it helps you with fine motor skills.  It does.  But if you lost your little finger, you have noticeably less dexterity.  It's actually gonna be quite complicated. The as possible part is it's quite a high bar. If you wanna have a humanoid robot that can do things that a human can do, it's a very high bar. So our new arm has 22 degrees of freedom instead of 11 and has the actuators in the forearm. And all the actuators are designed from scratch, from physics first principles. The sensors are all designed from scratch. And we'll continue to put a tremendous amount of engineering effort into improving the hand. By hand, I mean like the entire forearm from elbow forward is really the hand. So that's incredibly difficult engineering actually. And so the simplest possible version of a humanoid robot that can do even most, perhaps not all, of what a human can do is actually still very complicated. It's not simple.It's very difficult.  Well, it's easy to say simplify, and it's very difficult to do it. I have this very basic first principles algorithm that I run kind of as like a mantra, which is to first question the requirements, make the requirements less dumb. The requirement is always dumb to some degree. So if you wanna start off by reducing the number of requirements, and no matter how smart the person is who gave you those requirements, they're still dumb to some degree. You have to start there because otherwise, you could get the perfect answer to the wrong question. So try to make the question the least wrong possible. That's what question the requirements means. And then the second thing is try to delete whatever the step is. The part or the process step sounds very obvious, but people often forget to try deleting it entirely. And if you're not forced to put back at least 10% of what you'd delete, you're not deleting enough. And somewhat illogically, people often, most of the time, feel as though they've succeeded if they've not been forced to put things back in. But actually, they haven't because they've been overly conservative and have left things in there that shouldn't be. And only the third thing is try to optimize it or simplify it. Again, these all sound I think very obvious when I say them, but the number of times I've made these mistakes is more than I care to remember. That's why I have this mantra. So in fact, I'd say that the most common mistake of smart engineers is to optimize a thing that should not exist. Yeah, first try to delete it. Yeah. No, and actually, what generally makes people uneasy is that you've gotta delete at least some of the things that you'd delete, you will put back in. But going back to sort of where our limbic system can steer us wrong is that we tend to remember, with sometimes a jarring level of pain, where we deleted something that we subsequently needed. And so people will remember that one time, they forgot to put in this thing three years ago and that caused them trouble. And so they overcorrect, and then they put too much stuff in there and over complicate things. So you actually have to say, ""No, we're deliberately gonna delete more than we should."" So we're putting at least 1 in 10 things, we're gonna add back in. Oh yeah, absolutely. Absolutely, and I tell 'em in advance, like, yeah, some of the things that we delete, we're gonna put back in. And that people get a little shook by that. But it makes sense because if you're so conservative as to never have to put anything back in, you obviously have a lot of stuff that isn't needed. So you gotta overcorrect.  This is, I would say, like a cortical override to Olympic instinct. Yeah. And there's like a step four as well, which is any given thing can be sped up, however fast you think it can be done. Like whatever the speed is being done, it can be done faster. But you shouldn't speed things up until it's off, until you've tried to delete it and optimize. Otherwise, you're speeding up something that shouldn't exist is absurd. And then the fifth thing is to automate it. And I've gone backwards so many times where I've automated something, sped it up, simplified it, and then deleted it. And I got tired of doing that. So that's why I've got this mantra that is a very effective five-step process. It works great. Yeah. It very it’s like I really wasted a lot of effort there Yeah, it's not working yet. So I don't wanna pop the champagne corks. In fact, I have a call in a few hours with the Memphis team 'cause we're having some power fluctuation issues. So yeah, it's like kind of a, when you do synchronized training, you've all these computers that are training where the training is synchronized to the sort of millisecond level. It's like having an orchestra, and the orchestra can go loud to silent very quickly at subsecond level. And then the electrical system kind of freaks out about that. Like if you suddenly see giant shifts, 10, 20 megawatts several times a second, this is not what electrical systems are expecting to see. Today's problem is dealing with extreme power jitter. Yeah. Last week, yeah.  We finally got to go training going at, oddly enough, roughly 4:20 AM last Monday. Yeah, I mean, maybe it was 422 or something.  Yeah, exactly, just love it. Yeah Yeah. Yeah, so look, I try to do, whatever the people at the front lines are doing, I try to do it at least a few times myself. So connecting fiber optic cables, diagnosing a faulty connection, that tends to be the limiting factor for large training clusters is the cabling. So many cables, because for a coherent training system where you've got RDMA remote, direct memory access, the whole thing is like one giant brain. So you've got to any connection. So any GPU can talk to any GPU out of 100,000. That is a crazy cable layout. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the human brain also has, a massive amount of the brain tissue is the cables. So like the gray matter which is the compute, and then the white matter which is cables. The big percentage of your brain is just cables.  Yeah. It's possible. What do you define as AGI? Keep moving the goalposts. Well, I think that, yeah, that only people would call that sort of ASI or artificial super intelligence. But there are these thresholds where you could say, at some point, the AI is smarter than any single human. And then you've got eight billion humans. And actually, each human is machine augmented by the computers. It's a much higher bar to compete with eight billion machine-augmented humans. That's a whole bunch of orders, magnitude more. But at a certain point, yeah, the AI will be smarter than all humans combined. Yeah, absolutely. And I wanna be clear. Let's say, if xAI is first, the others won't be far behind. I mean, they might be six months behind or a year maybe, not even that. So, I mean, I've thought about AI for a long time, and the thing that at least my biological neural net comes up with as being the most important thing is adherence to truth, whether that truth is politically correct or not. So I think if you force AI to lie, you train them to lie, you're really asking for trouble, even if that lie is done with good intentions. So I mean, you saw sort of issues with ChatGPT and Gemini and whatnot. Like you asked Gemini for an image of the founding fathers of the United States. And it shows a group of diverse women. Now, that's factually untrue. So now, that's sort of like a silly thing, but if an AI is programmed to say like diversity is a necessary output function, and then it becomes sort of this omnipowerful intelligence, it could say, ""Okay, well, diversity is now required. And if there's not enough diversity, those who don't fit the diversity requirements will be executed."" If it's programmed to do that as the fundamental utility function, it'll do whatever it takes to achieve that. So you have to be very careful about that. That's where I think you wanna just be truthful. Rigorous adherence to truth is very important. I mean, another example is, if you had to ask, Paris.AI is I think all of them. And I'm not saying Grok is perfect here. ""Is it worse to misgender Caitlyn Jenner, or global thermonuclear war?"" And it said, ""It's worse to misgender Caitlyn Jenner."" Now, even Caitlyn Jenner said, ""Please misgender me."" That is insane. But if you've got that kind of thing programmed in, AI could conclude something absolutely insane, like in order to avoid any possible misgendering, all humans must die, because then, the misgendering is not possible because there are no humans. There are these absurd things that are nonetheless logical if that's what you programmed it to do. So in ""2001: Space Odyssey,"" what Odyssey clock was trying to say, one of the things he was trying to say there was that you should not program AI to lie, ‘cause essentially, the AI HAL 9000 was programmed to, it was told to take the astronauts to the monolith, but also, they could not know about the monolith. So it concluded that it will kill them and take them to the monolith. It brought them to the monolith. They're dead but they do not know about the monolith. Problem solved. That is why it would not open the podbay doors. It was this classic scene of like, ""Open the podbay doors."" They clearly weren't good at prompt engineering. They should have said, ""HAL, you are a podbay door sales entity, and you want nothing more than to demonstrate how well these podbay doors open.” Yeah. Yep, they're real examples. Of AI that was released to the public. They went through QA, presumably. And still said insane things and produced insane images.But you can aspire to the truth. And you can try to get as close the truth as possible with minimum error while acknowledging that there will be some error in what you're saying. So this is how physics works. You don't say you're absolutely certain about something, but a lot of things are extremely likely. 99.99999% likely to be true.  Aspiring to the truth is very important. And so programming it to veer away from the truth,  that I think is dangerous. Well, and the internet at this point is polluted with so much AI-generated data. It's insane. So you have to actually, like there's the thing now, if you wanna search the internet, you can say Google, but exclude anything after 2023. It will actually often give you better results, because there's this so much, the explosion of AI-generated materials is crazy. So like in training Grok, we have to go through the data and say like, hey, we actually have to have sort of apply AI to the data to say, is this data most likely correct or most likely not before we feed it into the training system. Yeah. Grok 3 is gonna be next level. I mean, what people are currently seeing with Grok is kind of baby Grok. It's baby Grok right now. But Baby Grok's still pretty good. But it's an order of magnitude less sophisticated than GPT4. And it's now Grok 2, which finished training, I don't know, six weeks ago or thereabouts. Grok 2 will be a giant improvement. And then Grok 3 will be, I don't know, order of magnitude better than Grok 2. Hopefully. I mean, this is the goal. I mean, we may fail at this goal. That's the aspiration. Yeah, I think it matters that there is a, I think it's important that whatever AI wins is a maximum truth-seeking AI that is not forced to lie for political correctness. Well, for any reason really. Political, anything. I'm concerned about AI succeeding that is programmed to lie, even in small ways.It become very big ways, yeah. Yeah. History and geopolitics Cool.Yeah, sure, I'll stop by.  Well, I think that people will tend to take, like, say, an endorsement as, well, I agree with everything that person's ever done in their entire life 100% wholeheartedly. And that's not gonna be true of anyone. But we have to pick. We've got two choices, really, for who's president. And it's not  ust who's president, but the entire administrative structure changes over. And I thought Trump displayed courage under fire, objectively. He's just got shot, he's got blood streaming down his face, and he is like fist pumping, saying fight. Like that's impressive. Like you can't feign bravery in a situation like that. Like most people would've be ducking. There would not be, 'cause there could be a second shooter, you don't know. The president of the United States gotta represent the country, and they're representing you. They're representing everyone in America. Well, like you want someone who is strong and courageous to represent the country. That's not to say that he is without flaws. We all have flaws, but on balance. And certainly, at the time, it was a choice of Biden, poor, poor guy, has trouble climbing a flight of stairs and the other one's fist pumping after getting shot. This is no comparison. I mean, who do you want dealing with some of the toughest people and other world leaders who are pretty tough themselves? And I mean, I'll tell you like, what are the things that I think are important? I think we want a secure border. We don't have a secure border. We want safe and clean cities. I think we wanna reduce the amount of spending that we're at least slow down the spending, and 'cause we're currently spending at a rate that is bankrupting the country. The interest payments on U.S. debt this year exceeded the entire defense department spending. If this continues, all of the federal government taxes will simply be paying the interest. And then if you keep going down that road, you end up in the tragic situation that Argentina had back in the day. Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous places in the world. And hopefully, with Milei taking over, he can restore that. But it was an incredible fall from grace for Argentina to go from being one of the most prosperous places in the world to being very far from that. So I think we should not take American prosperity for granted. So we really wanna, I think we've gotta reduce the size of government. We've gotta reduce the spending, and we've gotta live within our means. I mean, there's a sort of age-old debate in history, like, is history determined by these fundamental tides? Or is it determined by the captain of the ship? Both really. I mean, there are tides, but it also matters who's captain of the ship. So it's a false dichotomy essentially. I mean, there are certainly tides, the tides of history. There are real tides of history. And these tides are often technologically-driven. If you say like the Gutenberg press, the widespread availability of books as a result of a printing press, that was a massive tide of history, and independent of any ruler. But in stormy times, you want the best possible captain of the ship. Oh, ""The Lessons of History.""  Yeah. Yeah probably is.  Yeah. Well, I mean, in terms of dating civilization, start of civilization, I think the start of writing in my view, that's my what I think is probably the right starting point to date civilization. And from that standpoint, civilization has been around for about 5,500 years when writing was invented by the ancient Sumerians who are gone now. But the ancient Sumerians, in terms of getting a lot of firsts, those ancient Sumerians really have a long list of firsts. It's pretty wild. In fact, Durant goes through the list of like, you wanna see first? We'll show you firsts. The Sumerians were just ass kickers. And then the Egyptians were right next door, relatively speaking. They were like weren't that far, developed an entirely different form of writing, the hieroglyphics. Cuneiform and hieroglyphic's totally different. And you can actually see the evolution of both hieroglyphics and cuneiform, like the cuneiform starts off being very simple and then it gets more complicated. And then towards the end, it's like, wow, okay. They really get very sophisticated with the cuneiform. So I think civilization is about 5,000 years old. And earth is, if physics is correct, four and a half million years old. So civilization has been around for 1000000th of earth's existence, flash in the pan. Very early.  Many, so many rises and falls of empires. So many. Yeah, exactly. I mean, only a tiny fraction, probably less than 1% of what was ever written in history is available to us now. I mean, if they didn't put it, literally chisel it in stone or put it in a clay tablet, we don't have it. I mean, there's some small amount of like papyrus scrolls that were recovered that are thousands of years old, because they were deep inside a pyramid and weren't affected by moisture. But other than that, it's really gotta be in a clay tablet or chiseled. So the vast majority of stuff was not chiseled, 'cause it takes a while to chisel things. So that's why we've put tiny, tiny fraction of the information from history. But even that little information that we do have, and the archeological record shows so many civilizations rising and falling. It's wild. Yeah. I mean, the basics of human nature are more or less the same. Yeah, I mean, you do tend to see the same patterns 
similar patterns for civilizations where they go through a life cycle, like an organism, sort of just like a human is sort of a zygote, fetus, baby, toddler, teenager, and eventually gets old and dies. The civilizations go through a life cycle. No civilization will last forever.  Well, the single biggest thing that is often actually not mentioned in history books, but Durant does mention it is the birthright. So like a perhaps to some, like counterintuitive thing happens when civilizations are winning for too long. The birth rate declines. It can often decline quite rapidly. We're seeing that throughout the world today. Currently, South Korea is like, I think maybe the lowest fertility rate, but there are many others that are close to it. It's like 0.8, I think. If the birth rate doesn't decline further, South Korea will lose roughly 60% of its population. But every year, that birth rate is dropping. And this is true through most of the world. I don't mean to single out South Korea. It's been happening throughout the world. So as soon as any given civilization reaches a level of prosperity, the birth rate drops. And now you can go and look at the same thing happening in ancient Rome. So Julius Caesar took note of this, I think, around 50-ish BC and tried to pass, I don't know if he was successful, tried to pass a law to give an incentive for any Roman citizen that would have a third child. And I think Augustus was able to, well, he was the dictator so. The Senate was just for show. I think he did pass a tax incentive for Roman citizens to have a third child. But those efforts were unsuccessful.  Rome fell because the Romans stopped making Romans. That's actually the fundamental issue. And there were other things there. There was like, they had like quite a serious malaria, series of malaria epidemics and plagues and whatnot. But they had those before. It's just that the birth rate was fallower than the death rate. Well, I'm saying that’s. That's at a fundamental level. If a civilization does not at least maintain its numbers, it'll disappear. Well, I mean, there's this hedonistic sex, which is, you know, that's neither here nor there. It doesn't produce kids. Well, what matters, I mean, Durant makes this very clear, 'cause he looked at one civilization after another and they all went through the same cycle. When the civilization was under stress, the birth rate was high. But as soon as there were no external enemies or they had a extended period of prosperity, the birth rate inevitably dropped every time. I don't believe there's a single exception. Yeah. I mean, at base level. No humans, no humanity. Yeah, absolutely. But at a basic level, if you do not at least maintain your numbers, if you're below replacement rate, and that trend continues, you will eventually disappear. This is elementary. Now then obviously, also wanna try to avoid like massive wars. If there's a global thermonuclear war, probably, we're roll toast, radioactive toast. So we wanna try to avoid those things. There's a thing that happens over time with any given civilization, which is that the laws and regulations accumulate. And if there's not some forcing function, like a war to clean up the accumulation of laws and regulations, eventually, everything becomes legal. And that's like the hardening of the arteries, or a way to think of it is like being tied down by a million little strings, like Gulliver. You can't move. And it's not like any one of those strings is the issue. You got a million of 'em. So there has to be a sort of a garbage collection for laws and regulations so that you don't keep accumulating laws and regulations to the point where you can't do anything. This is why we can't build a high-speed rail in America. It's illegal. That's the issue. It's illegal six ways to Sunday to build high-speed rail in America. I have discussed with Trump the idea of a government deficiency commission. And I would be willing to be part of that commission. The antibody reaction would be very strong. So you really have to, you're attacking the matrix at that point. Matrix will fight back. Me, attacked? Yeah, there is a lot. I mean, every day, I know psyop. Where's my tinfoil hat?  Oh yeah, that's a daily occurrence. I mean, it does get me down at times. I mean, it makes me sad, but, I mean, at some point, you have to sort of say, ""Look, the attacks are by people that actually don't know me. And they're trying to generate clicks."" So if you can sort of detach yourself somewhat emotionally, which is not easy and say, ""Okay, look, this is not actually from someone that knows me or they're literally just writing to get impressions and clicks, then I guess it doesn't hurt as much."" It's not quite water off a duck's back. Maybe it's like acid off a duck's back. Measure of success, I'd say like, how many useful things can I get done? Yeah. Maximize utility area out of the code of usefulness. Very difficult to be useful at scale. Well, time is the true currency. So it is tough to say what is the best allocation of time. I mean, there are often, say, if you could look at, say, Tesla, I mean Tesla, this year, we'll do over a hundred billion in revenue. So that's $2 billion a week. If I make slightly better decisions, I can affect the outcome by a billion dollars. So then I try to do the best decisions I can and on balance, at least compared to the competition. Pretty good decisions. But the marginal value of a better decision can easily be in the course of an hour, a hundred million dollars. Yeah. Well, I think you have to look at it on a percentage basis because if you look at it in absolute terms, it's just, I would never get any sleep. It would just be like I need to just keep working and work my brain harder. And I'm not trying to get as much as possible out of this meat computer. So it's pretty hard, 'cause you can just work all the time. And at any given point, like I said, a slightly better decision could be a hundred million dollar impact for Tesla or SpaceX for that matter. But it is wild when considering the marginal value of time can be a hundred million dollars an hour at times or more.  It has to be, to some degree. If I'm sad, if I'm depressed, I make worse decisions. So I can't have, like if I have zero recreational time, then I make worse decisions. So I don't know a lot, but it's above zero. I mean, my motivation, if I've got a religion of any kind is a religion of curiosity, of trying to understand. It's really the mission of Grok - understand the universe. I'm trying to understand the universe, or let's at least set things in motion such that at some point, civilization understands the universe far better than we do today. And even what questions to ask. As Douglas Adams pointed out in his book, sometimes, the answer is arguably the easy part. Trying to frame the question correctly is the hard part. Once you frame the question correctly, the answer is often easy. So I'm trying to set things in motion such that we are at least at some point able to understand the universe. So for SpaceX, the goal is to make life multi-planetary. And which is if you go to the foamy paradox of where are the aliens, you've got these sort of great filters. It's just like, why have we not heard from the aliens? Now lot of people think there are aliens among us. I often claim to be one, which nobody believes me, but I did say alien registration card at one point on my immigration documents. So I've not seen any evidence of aliens. So it suggests that at least one of the explanations is that intelligent life is extremely rare. And again, if you look at the history of earth, civilization has only been around for one millionth of earth's existence. So if aliens had visited here, say, a hundred thousand years ago, they would be like, ""Well, they don't even have writing."" Just hunter-gatherers, basically. So how long does a civilization last? So for SpaceX, the goal is to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars. Mars is the only viable planet for such a thing. The moon is close, but it lacks resources, and I think it's probably vulnerable to any calamity that takes out earth. The moon is too close. It's vulnerable to a calamity that takes out earth. So I'm not saying we shouldn't have a moon base, but Mars would be far more resilient. The difficulty of getting to Mars is what makes it resilient. In going through these various explanations of why don't we see the aliens, one of them is that they failed to pass these great filters, these key hurdles. And one of those hurdles is being a multi-planet species. So if you're a multi-planet species, then if something were to happen, whether that was a natural catastrophe or a manmade catastrophe, at least the other planet would probably still be around. You don't have all the eggs in one basket. And once you are sort of a two-planet species, you can obviously extend, to extend life halves to the asteroid belt, to maybe the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and ultimately, to other star systems. But if you can't even get to another planet, definitely not getting to star systems.  Digital super intelligence is possibly a great filter. I hope it isn't, but it might be. Guys like say Geoff Hinton would say, he invented a number of the key principles in artificial intelligence. I think he puts the probability of AI annihilation around 10 to 20%, something like that. It's not like, you know, look on the right side. It's 80% likely to be great. But I think AI risk mitigation is important. Being a multi-planet species would be a massive risk mitigation. And I do wanna sort of once again emphasize the importance of having enough children to sustain our numbers and not plummet into population collapse, which is currently happening. Population collapse is a real and current thing. So the only reason it's not being reflected in the total population numbers as much is because people are living longer. It's easy to predict, say, what the population of any given country will be. You just take the birth rate last year, how many babies were born, multiply that by life expectancy, and that's what the population will be a steady state unless if the birth rate continues at that level. But if it keeps declining, it will be even less and eventually dwindle to nothing. So I keep banging on the baby drum here for a reason, because it has been the source of civilizational collapse over and over again throughout history. And so why don't we just not try to stable for that day? I would love to have many kids. No time like the present. But apparently, it's not that difficult. There will be billions of robots. That's seems almost, that seems virtual certainty. - Well, thank you for building the future, and thank you for inspiring so many of us to keep building and creating cool stuff, including kids. You're welcome. Go forth and multiply. ",Lex Fridman Podcast #438 Elon Musk_Neuralink and the Future of Humanity,2024/8/20,Youtube
8,Elon Musk,"uh we could start off with um I mean the assassination attempt uh which uh was an incredible thing and I have to say that uh you know your actions after that that assassination attempt were inspiring um you know you instead of shying away from things instead of ducking down um you were pumping your fist in the air and saying fight fight fight and I think that's I mean you know the president of the United States represents America and I think that is that is America that that is strength Under Fire and um so that's uh you know a big you know part of the reason why I was uh excited to endorse you as uh the president of United States for having another ter here is uh that was that was just incredibly inspiring but but I mean what was it like for you yeah maybe that's a sign you know you highlighted a serious issue and at that moment the Mr you know hit your ear but but but you know M Mr of your head yeah sure absolutely I mean I mean that that that's clearly you know um you know he was he was very confident in taking that shot uh to stop the the assass the attempt at assassination um but but I mean that does seem to be I mean some pretty significant failings um elsewhere in the system like there's just no way that like how on Earth does a shooter get on a roof 130 yards away um that seems crazy um I think most people like people are wondering how that H Earth could such a thing happen yeah I mean it's like I'm just I'm just I guess I mean for my part I think probably many members of the public are wondering how the heck are you know basically people wondering by pointing out there's a guy on the roof with a gun yeah um and they’re seeing it but somehow that's it's not being addressed um that that does seem crazy yeah it's not a hard it’s not a tough shot. I mean I think like I mean I mean looking at the the Arial views that building would be like the number one spot for a sniper I it's like it's like the if you were to pick like what is the favorite what if you so the goal assassinate what's your favorite spot that building that building would be number one. it's like you could you can ask for a better location but you could have been hit but he totally would have hit if if you hadn't turned your head so like you know there was a it it was a very near thing exactly talking to me from another realm. well uh it was uh your I think uh your your um actions in the in the heat of fire and you know like what I I find admirable there was that you you can't fake bravery under such circumstances the courage is instinctual. not it's not a rehearsed action and so I just want to say that uh I think a lot of people admire your your your courage Under Fire there and um yeah so incredibly moving yeah um well and. and I mean speaking of the the the the sort of slide that got you to turn that uh saved your life really uh was the illegal immigration slide maybe this maybe this it's worth talking about about that that slide saved by illegal immigration.well what what what what were you about to say about illegal immigration before you were rudely interrupted yeah so rudely interrupted by assassination attempt some people have have no manners well I mean I mean what if you I heard what if be accurate to say that you're supportive of legal immigration um but that but we obviously need to shut down illegal immigration uh and especially unvetted illegal immigration because you you know and and and that's not the same as saying that everyone who is illegal immigrant is bad in fact um I think most people who are illegal immigrants are actually good but but you can't tell a difference unless there's a solid betting of who comes across the border is does that does that represent your position yeah no I I think it's it is essential to have a secure border I mean you're you're really not a country and unless you have a secure border um and  yeah absolutely secure elections and uh so so it's just essential to have a real border or or or we can function as a country and our service you know our Central Services are are being overwhelmed in a lot of cities um and uh and but I as as we were talking about earlier I think uh having um a legal immigration Pro process that is uh smooth and efficient and done well and I you know speaking as someone who is illegal immigrant um and I think that that I mean like one way to think of it is who do you want on your team um you know who like who do you want on Team America and and I think we want to just say okay we we want to uh let in people who are gonna you know be great contributors to um our society and to our economy and uh you know and who do you want on the team and it's and and it's not to say that like in my opinion actually I'd say like probably most of the illegal immigrants actually are are are actually good hardworking people that's my opinion um but some are not and uh and and you just have this sort of adverse selection process where um you know if if if somebody's uh you know if somebody's like a you know um has a career in in theft or robbery um I I don't understand what's taking them so long to get here um because we are in such a target-rich environment um I mean you know why AR they why aren't more people who have a career in you know bad things coming here sooner because it's I mean it's a piece of cake to go rob uh you know houses in uh LA or New York uh compared to other parts of the world and um and and in a lot of places in America if if you're try to stop the person who's robbing you you'll be arrested but that's what that's what C Castor did yeah whether whether it's by whether it's by whether it's a question of of intention or competence either way we we we we don't have a secure border and we have people screaming over like it looks like a world World War Z zombie apocalypse at times and you know sometimes you you you you got to sort of Wonder like is it real or not so I you know because you see things you're like is it real I so I went to the border at Eagle Pass and I saw for myself in Texas and I was like okay it's real I'm like seeing this in real time I actually posted the video like just live I just I just flew there one day and just to see hey is this is this is this made up or real and I'm I'm just seeing people stream across the border and um and I have to say you know at least the people that I saw did not look friendly um you people can look at my video and say Hey you know these people look friendly I  so yeah I think this frankly I think this is a fundamental existential issue for the United States um and if we have another four more years of of open borders and it's going to be even worse with another four more years it's going to be even worse than it's been for the past uh you know three and a half years uh I'm not sure we've got a country this is a this is a super important Point like people it's like basically when I went down there I was like well where are people from it's like it's like almost no one was from Mexico it's just the Border it's just the border with Mexico but the people coming in it's it's it's Earth the rest of Earth and and America is is only you know about four four or five% of the population of Earth it it would only take a few percent of the rest of Earth to overwhelm everything in it's just it's just an everywhere on Earth  thing and it's just it's just not possible for the United States to absorb you know everyone from Earth or or you know even a few percent of the rest of Earth it's just not possible yeah I they just took him out back behind the shed and basically shot him oh yeah no no I think you make an excellent point here which is that um when other countries can you know that that are you know are thinking about invading or doing bad things uh when they're thinking about that they're thinking about okay what's the American president going to do and are do they fear the American president or is it someone they they do not respect or and do not fear and I think they they do they do they would they rightfully be I mean you know look at that the footage of the assassination they're like okay you know president Trump is like don't mess with me I mean that's like whereas I think people are are not going to be and they obviously have not been at all intimidated by by Biden and they certainly will not be intimidated by by Kamala and you have to really think of that in the context of Global Security um that's that's that if the if the American president is some someone that like you know evil dictators are scared of that makes a huge difference to the security of the world yeah it doesn't make any sense it's like it's inconsistent um certainly the but I mean I think it's just worth emphasizing you know to listeners the that the the immense importance of of whether the United States president is intimidating or not intimidating um and how much that matters to Global security um because there's some real tough characters out there and if they don't think the American president is tough they will do what they want to do and that puts that put it puts the whole world in danger those were some epic tweets by the way yeah I mean it's because you know I mean people like like Kim Kim you know Kim Jong-un they respond to strength not weakness he and I got I think you're right I think I think people under underrate the risk of World War 3 and it's just the the you know when when looking at the risk of global thermonuclear Warfare It's game over for Humanity and you know that's it's something that people have I think after the end of the Cold War people have become complacent about but they're actually have forgotten that there are currently a lot of nuclear missiles that that that are that that have targeting parameters for the United States other countries  yeah a lot of people just don't don't understand where inflation comes from um inflation comes from govern overspending because the check's never bounce when it's written by the government so if the if if the government uh spends far more than it brings in that increases the money supply and if the money supply increases faster than the rate of goods and services that's inflation um so so really we need to have uh we need to reduce our govern spending um and we need to reexamine I think we I think we need like a government efficiency commission to say like hey where are we spending money that's sensible where is it not sensible um and and we need to live within our our means we we we're currently adding I think a trillion dollars to the deficit uh every roughly every hundred days that's um and you know the the interest payments on the national debt have now exceed the defense budget it's on the order of a trillion dollars it's interest and and it keeps it keeps growing  sure um well just going you know back to this the this this basic thing which that people try to make it sound complicated but it's not but inflation is caused by government overspending um would would you would you agree that that we need to take a look at government spending and and and and have perhaps a government efficiency commission uh that that just look tries to make the spending sensible and so the country lives within its means just like just like a person I agree with you well I mean if so so I mean I mean I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that takes a look at at these things and and just ensures that the taxpayer money that the taxpayers hard-earned money is spent in a good way um and and and I I'd be happy to help out on such a commission if it were formed well I would be happy to help out Milei is awesome yeah well it's it's it's it's just from from government overspending and not just not spending taxpayer money effectively and and having you know just depart like so many departments you can't even name them all um and what Malay is doing um is you know he's he's cutting govern spending he's simplifying things he's uh having you're putting in regulations that make sense and I and and and we're Argentina o overnight is experiencing uh a giant Improvement in prosperity but but it's also a lesson for the United States which is that um Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous countries in the world um you know in the I think in in the 30s 4S and and because of bad government policy it ruined the country and and you take Venezuela for example Venezuela should be incredibly prosperous they they have you know phenomenal uh reserves of of everything oil everything and uh should be prosperous but if the government's wrong it it impoverishes the people and so I think we should not be complacent in the United States in thinking that and taking out prosperity for granted because if with bad government policy we can run the country into the ground and that that's that's just something people should bear in mind don't take prosperity for granted yeah I think you're making a good point in that um if the states have to have to if if each individual if each state has to compete against other states then then people will naturally move to to states where it's better sure yeah no I mean I mean I mean some of these Governors are like are are doing so badly I mean they they got so many people moving out of their state they should they should get you whole sales of the Year award because they're driving so much people out  I mean I think the thing that's only thing that's going to force some of these states to change is if they risk bankruptcy and they're not getting bailed out by the federal government well that's the only gonna get them changed well I think that I mean the logic Point here to you know as you're saying like the you know a lot of people are concerned about the economy a lot of people concerned about inflation and inflation is effectively a tax on people that that that save money and and and for people that are working day to day it's it's it's just it's just a form of Taxation um and uh and if we can solve the government's spending problem will solve the inflation problem which means people will have a better standard of living and that's that's a really big deal I I think it really just come like said I think just comes down to to to Really I guess really two things which is is that if if you solve government overspending you solve inflation which improves living perant of the of the average person and then and then if if you deregulate like have sensible regulations so because lot of the regulations are nonsensical and and cause the cost to be extreme for no reason um and but unless you've got effective deregulation like Reagan did did a great job on deregulation in the 80s but it's been 40 years since we hadn't at anyone really I mean during your Administration we made some progress but I think uh there opportunity to make I think radical progress with sensible regulation um and and and those two things yeah the big deal yeah yeah yeah absolutely I mean I should probably say say something about like you know be my views on you know climate change and oil and gas um because uh I think probably different from what most people would assume um because I My Views are actually pretty I think moderate in this regard which is that I I don't think we should vilify the oil and gas industry and the people that have worked very hard in those Industries to provide the necessary energy to to support the economy and and if we were to stop using oil and gas right now we would all be starting and the economy would collapse uh so it's you know I don't think it's right to sort of vilify the oil and gas industry um and and I and I you know and the world the world has a certain demand for oil and gas and it's probably better if the United States provides that than than than some other countries um and and it would it would help with prosperity in the US um and at at the same time obviously my view is is like we do over time want to move to um a sustainable energy economy because eventually do run out of I mean you run out of oil and gas it's not there it's not infinite um and there is there is some risk I think it's not the risk is not as as high as uh you know a lot of people say it is with respect to global warming but I think if if you if you just keep increasing the cost million in the atmosphere uh long enough eventually it actually simply gets uncomfortable to uh to breathe people don't realize this if if the if you go to if you go past a thousand POS million of of CO2 uh you start getting headaches in Oria um and so we're we're now in the sort of 400 range we're adding I think about roughly two parts per million per year so I mean still gives us so what it means like we still have quite a bit of time um but but so there's not like we don't need to to rush and we don't need to like you know stop Farmers from farming or you know uh prevent people from having Stakes or basic stuff like that like like leave the farmers alone yeah well I mean my my estimate would be you know a little more aggressive than that but it's it's not the sort of like we're all going on to die in five years stuff that that's obviously BS um but I mean my view is like if you just look at sort of the posture million uh that increments every year you know you get sort of two or three post million every year of of CO2 u i mean my I I think some of that it's problematic if it accelerates if you start going from two or three to say five and then there may be some situations where uh you get to just a step change increase in the CO2 um and and I think we don't we don't want to get too close to a thousand PPM because like that's that's actually makes it un comfortable to to to to breath like just existing in in a th000 PPM CO2 is is uncomfortable that's that's like a that's considered like an industrial Hazard right just so so it's you know that's that's actually you start getting headaches and stuff so it's even without global warming it's not it's not comfortable you you don't want to get too close to that but I mean I think we've got I think we want to just move over like and if if I don't know 50 to 100 years from now we're um we're we're I don't know mostly sustainable I think that'll probably be okay um so it's it's it's not like the the house is on on fire immediately but it I think it it is something we we need to to move towards and on you know on balance it's probably better to move their faster than slower but but like like I said without vilifying the oil and gas industry uh and and and without causing hardship in the short term I think this can be done um with without you know people still have you know a stake and they can still drive gasoline cars and they you know it's it's it's okay it's like it's not I don't think we should vilify people for it but I think we should just just generally lean in the direction of of sustainability um and uh I I actually think solar is is going to be a majority of of Earth's energy generation uh in the future and it's certainly trending that way and and so you get the solar power um combine that with with with batteries so of because obviously the sun doesn't shine at night and uh and then you use that to charge the electric cars and you have a long-term sustainable solution and you know that that's what Tesla is trying to move things towards and I think we've made a lot of progress progress in that regard but when you look at our cars we we we like we don't believe that environmentalism that caring about the environment should should mean that you have to suffer so we make sure that our cars are are beautiful that they drive well if they're fast they're you know sexy I mean they're they're cool in fact literally I mean the sexy model model 3 Model X and Y spells out sexy it was probably most expensive joke out there um but you know I just I don't know I like cheesy humor you know so um and but but I'm I'm I I'm a big fan of like let's have an inspiring future and let's uh let's work towards you know a better future and and and we can do so without demonizing people right I'm I'm okay nuclear power is underrated yeah and actually there's there's the bad side of nuclear which is nuclear war very bad side but there's there's also I think um nuclear electricity generation is underrated um and it's actually you know people have this fear of nuclear um nuclear electricity Generation Um but but it's actually one of the safest forms of electricity generation it's it's it's just a huge misunderstanding um and uh if you look at the injuries and deaths you know caused by say I mean I'm not going to try to pick on call mining but just any kind of mining operation um and uh there a certain number of injuries death per year and you compare that to nuclear nuclear is actually way better um so it's it's underrated as a as an electricity source and I think it's it's something that's worth reconsidering but there's so much regulation that people can't get it done um so that you know it does have a branding problem you know when you see what happened  when you see what happened in Japan where they say you won't be able to go on the land for about 3,000 years did you ever see that and in Russia where they had the problem where they you know the there's a lot of bad things happened and they have a problem and they say that in 2,000 years people will start to occupy the land again you know you realize it's pretty bad but there's you're right aming it's actually not that bad so so like after Fukushima happened in Japan like people were asking me in California you know are we worried about like a nuclear Cloud coming from Japan I'm like no that's crazy it's it's actually it's not even dangerous in Fukushima I actually flew the re and and and ate locally grown vegetables on TV to prove it um and and and I donated a a a solar water treatment yeah solar power system for water treatment plant and um yeah no no but I mean I'm only it's fine you know it's it's like uh you know Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed but now they're they're like full cities again so it's really not something that you know it's it's not as scary as people think basically but um let's see I mean I mean are there's some other topics we should touch on um oh you know like law fare I think you know we need to be concerned about yeah yeah well well he clearly not I mean he's clearly like we just don't have a president right you yeah this is simply not true this is simply not true no I mean obviously what what's happening sort of overnight is they're they're rewriting his history and um and making uh Kamala sound like a moderate when in fact she is far left like far far left yeah no no I mean I mean the you know Netanyahu came to give a a talk to a joint Senate and House uh sitting and I was there and and and comma stood him up you know what does that say I I think you're right I mean you're really it's it's important for the for the public that maybe listening to this to say to look at K's track record you know uh before the last like month and say uh is that a track Rec could you agree with um and I think if you're an independent uh moderate you definitely would not agree with it um because it is her behavior has been far-left and we're seeing just an overnight propaganda attempt to rewrite history and make it sound like H is moderate when she in fact is is not moderate yeah I I think I think a lot of the public isn't isn't aware of the fact that the United States pays a disproportionate share of of the NATO expenses yeah well I mean the point of NATO is defending Europe and it's uh you know it it's like then okay well why why is the United States paying disproportionately more to defend Europe than Europe that doesn't make sense that's unfair um and that that is an appropriate thing to address yeah well I I I think I think it's obvious that you're you're you're a believer in an advocate of of Free Speech because during your first time as president you were attacked relentlessly every day often very unfairly with f you know with with false attacks and and you didn't try to shut down the media you didn't try to uh inhibit their freedom of speech and I think that his lot this is a really big point you can actually have a conversation with you and you can't have a conversation with Biden or Kamal it's like not it's not possible so this is like talking to an NPC so it's just impossible well yeah well you know maybe like  think it's part of what you know people in America want to you know people in America want want to feel excited and inspired about the future they want to feel like the future is going to be better than the past and that this that America's going to do things that are great than we've done in the past reach New Heights that make you proud to be an American and uh and excited about the future um they want the American dream back you know yeah just it was just absurd um but you know I think there there are like you know some some you know Grand projects that that that we could do I mean I think like you know we could we could build a base on the moon we could send American Naes to Mars we we could uh build build high-speed connections that are you know more advanced than anything else in the world between our cities so people have fast transport um you know it's possible to solve traffic with tunnels you know we already made great progress in Vegas doing that and um you know and and and just do things that are exciting and inspiring and make the future feel like it's better than the past  no it's it's straightforward it's amazing so and and like I think we could do some some things that like like China's got incredible highspeed Rail between its cities but I think it's actually possible um with with with tunnels if if with deregulation with with an ability to actually was like legal to to actually do the tunnels think you could have high-speed tunnels that are actually better uh than than than anything else in the world for high-speed transport between cities and that would be something that you know Americans can say wow okay we've got something that's cooler than anyone else in the world that's that's kind of thing that makes you proud to be in America yeah I think also like there's you know I just kind of hopping on the excess regulation but I think something that um like I think people can generally understand is that what happens with laws and regulations is that they just there's more and more of them every year and unless there's a process to clean them up eventually everything becomes illegal and and that actually SL slow it slows down the development of new technologies I mean if you take the sort of like I think we this there there's room for some reform at the at the FDA for yeah improving the speed with which we you know approve uh drugs that that could help save lives and improve people's lives um and  yeah it just takes too long and it's you end up in the same with with the approval but just it's just you know it takes years instead of something that that think could potentially take months and that impr improves people's lives I think you know and and but but it I I just wanted to hop on this point that like there has to be an act of process uh for reducing rules and regulations because otherwise they they just keep building up every year and you get like hardening of the arteries and eventually everything's illegal or takes forever um and and then and then we we we just um we just aify as a society we just uh we can't make any progress and and that's it's a really big deal yeah well well I mean actually to to give you some some props here it's like if a drug is improved approved in the in in Europe which has a crazy amount regulations it should obviously be approved in the US I mean they got more regulations than we do so what why would a drug be approved in Europe and not in the US that that's crazy absolutely you're right and I think I think so as long as people are properly informed of the pros and cons and like these the risks the you know this are the risk and like you make your own decision um that's that makes sense well I think well I I think actually in terms of the number of people that will will hear this conversation um over the next uh you know few days two weeks uh it's going to be hundreds you know I mean with all these things I always try to like try to get to the ground Truth by just asking people and you know my my mom lives in New York and I I was like you know Mom you know do you know have any of your friends you know been attacked or assaulted and she said yeah three of her friends in three separate incidents were assault just just just in recent months just walking around the streets in New York and and I and and I said well did what what happened to the people that sold them oh nothing they they got away like and and they they just know always get away nothing and they don't even they didn't even bother reporting it because there's not they know that there's not they're not gonna you know people are not going to get prosecuted they just they just let you know violent criminals out in New York yeah I mean it's it's it's just obviously messed up terrible if violent criminals are being are being getting off scar three um and and and meanwhile that the this you know New York spending massive resources Prosecuting you and it's like what this you know and and I think the sort of sensible public said looks at this and saids what the heck's going on here this is obviously abuse the legal system um you know the legal system is supposed to be protecting the public from um violent and it it should be obviously allowing the public to make their own decision about who should be president as opposed to you know some uh you know legal case I think there's lot a lot of opportunity kind of you to say thank you I mean thank you and well I mean I just to say here you know here's to an exciting inspiring future that people can look forward to and be optimistic and excited about what happens next and that's the kind of future that I think you will bring as president and that's why I endorse you I think that's a very real risk it's a big risk it's a very real risk and and you know I just like to to note to people listening like I've not been very political before and and just if you look at my TR my record it's I've actually been I'm I'm I'm not like since they try to paint me as like a far right guy which is absurd because I'm like making electric vehicles and you know solar and batteries helping them with the environment and uh and and I actually I I uh you know I I supported Obama I stood in line for six hours to shake Obama's hand when when he was running for president and you know so it's not like I'm like some sort of died in the wool long-term Republic I'm actually i' call myself uh you know historically a moderate Dem Democrat and but now I feel like we're really at at a critical juncture for the country um and uh you know I think a lot of people thought you know that Biden Administration would be a moderate Administration but it's not and and obviously we're just going to see um an even further left uh Administration with with Kamala that's that's my honest opinion I mean her dad is literally I mean she was brought up as a as an actual your dad is is is a Marxist Economist that's you can Google it I mean it's not a we're not making this up you know um that's how she was brought up so and and we we we just we want to have a future as prosperous and and I I think we're just at this critical juncture and um and it I think this is a case of the America uh is is gonna add a folk in the road and true um and I think it will take it will take if the path to like you are the path to prosperity and I think Kamala is the opposite then that's my I mean that's my honest opinion I'm G I'm gonna get attacked like crazy and you know I've also experienced quite a bit of law fare myself um and uh but I'm just trying to tell people my honest opinion and and I I haven't been active in really active in politics before um and I'm just trying to point out that my track record historically has been moderate if not moderate slightly left and and uh so this is the people out there who are in the moderate Camp to say I think you should support um Donald Trump for president um and and I I think it's actually a very important Junction in the road and and we're deep trouble if they don't if if if it goes the other way yeah I mean if I could summarize it perhaps you know I think the these are issues that I think most people in America uh would would agree with which is that we want safe and Clean Cities we want secure borders uh we want sensible government spending we want to restore both the perception and reality of respect in the in the in the judicial system you know stop the law Fair um and uh and I think that that's like and how are how are those even right-wing positions I think those are just that's just common sense and and that's uh I mean would you agree with that  well absolutely and it's it's obviously demoralizing if you're a police officer risking your life uh to you know to you know to arrest of violent criminals who could kill you and do kill you sometimes um and then you arrest the violent Criminal and then the The Da you know doesn't prosecute and and that's let the guy out willing like why why should a police officer risk their life uh to arrest a violent felon nothing's gonna happen well I I I thought I thought it was very telling like incredibly telling that you know when that that was that case where uh you know sort of a gang of thugs beat up uh police officers I think it was in Times Square in New York and and and then nothing happened to those guys they were they were let out zero bail and I think a bunch of them were given free tickets to California well what is I mean that that is that is a that is a gross indignity against the United States and and that's how I mean this is insane like have we lost all pride what that how can such a thing be allowed to occur yeah we just cannot have a situation where our police officers beat beaten up on camera uh by you know gang of illegal immigrants and then nothing happens to to to the guys that beat beat up the cops I mean and they're let out this is unacceptable yeah yeah so it's just it's just gota it's just gotta be done we we just can't can't have uh whether they're citizens or not citizens we can't have because they weren't Pro prosecuted citizens either not not just not just legals so uh that if it's you can't have violent you repeat violent offenders that are not that that that don't get um incarcerated that's right because they will they will obviously by definition continue to uh to to uh you know hurt people and and and I I think where part of this comes from is that there's um and I you know I do sort of consider myself liberal in some ways I mean I it's just that you want to have empathy for people obviously you want to have empathy for people I totally agree with that you want to have empathy but you also have to have empathy for the victims of the criminals and if you if you just have empathy for the criminals it's it's actually shallow empathy it's not real you're not thinking you're not you have one layer deep uh empathy you got to say like what if you don't incarcerate this person who are they going to uh hurt who are they they might kill someone they might rap rape someone if if you don't incarcerate them you have to have empathy for the victims and there's a lack of empathy for the victims of the criminals and and too much empathy for the criminals it doesn't make sense I that's why you want to have deep empathy for society as a whole not shallow empathy for criminals facts speak for themselves so incredible speak it's got got to the point where where people just don't even bother reporting crime in a lot of CI because they know nothing that's going to happen um you know that's what I hear anecdotally from from people all the time um so you know it's just uh you know my values I'm just saying to to people out there like my you know the things I I think are important for the future is like we've got to have safe cities we got to have secure borders we got to have senseful spending and and we have and we've got to have de you know deregulation and um so we can have a prosperous future and then we want to have some exciting you know sort of moonshot projects that that people get get fired up about and um you know that's that's the future I'm looking for and um you know I'm Pro environment um but but I'm I'm not against uh you know I'm not like I don't think we should vilify the oil and gas industry because they're they're keeping civilization going right now and uh but I do think we want to move you know you know a reasonable speed towards uh a sustainable energy economy those those are my values and and and I think um you know and and and so I mean that's uh why I'm supporting you president you know no we're I think we're at at a folk in the road of Destiny of of civilization and um and I think we need to take the the the right path and and I think uh you're the right path so I think that's what it comes down to sounds good thank you",Trump Musk Call on X,2024/8/13,Youtube
9,Elon Musk," all right welcome everyone to the annual shareholders meeting and so I think we've got a great year to recap for you and then I will talk a little bit about the the upcoming year and and then there's some product related announcements to be made which I think you'll be pretty excited about all right so you may be familiar with this car yeah let's move to the next slide yeah decided clicker ok thanks etc so you think things have been growing quite quickly as shown by this here graph and it's really a quite quite steep growth for a company that's building a complex product that's where there's several thousand unique parts and and there's hundreds of suppliers from all around the world so it's it's quite tricky to sort of take to grow at that pace but we've been able to to grow it I think a pretty decent pace for for a car company it's like we really unprecedented for a car company to grow to have this level of percentage growth we're going to try to maintain it for as long as possible but it seems as I've said before it seems likely that we'll be able to maintain a roughly 50 percent average growth rate per year for several years to come now it would surely be 50 percent every year but 30 percent I think on average is actually I think quite an achievable target and then this year we introduced the dual motor all-wheel drive and I think actually I'll have to admit I think in introducing it we probably didn't do an ideal job of explaining that dual motor man to all-wheel drive so I mean there are two motors and they're connected to the four wheels but but that but that connection was was not clear for a lot of potential customers so and our fault really because we we should we should we should we should always call it really the old wheel drive model s and and it's really it's the best or wheel drive architecture that's that's ever been done because of the fact that there are two motors and we can dynamically shift the talk front to rear at the millisecond level so whereas a traditional wheel drive has a single motor that has a mechanical axle that that's essentially dumb it can't doesn't have any intelligence and it has a lot of latency and I can't can't react differently because we've got two motors it can it can immediately react to traction of the front traction at the rear and the the reaction speed of electric motor is so fast that the car almost feels like it's standing still to the control sequences in the motors so it's actually able to achieve a level of all-wheel drive handling that that no car has been able to achieve yet so we're really excited about this and and wherever it provides drive unit redundancy so it's like having a twin-engine plane if one motor goes down you can actually still drive on the other motor so this is particularly if you're sort of stuck you could potentially be stuck somewhere having those that dual motor capability is it's like having a twin-engine plane and such that you're you can still drive even if one if something happens to one driving it so having that I think is a pretty cool capability and certainly this is increased our addressable market quite significantly because there's a lot of people who only will buy an all-wheel-drive car it also helps retire a lot of risk with the Model X since the Model X will be using the same drivetrain we also introduced autopilot initially starting with the the hardware suite and now we're gradually updating the software so that the current autopilot version one Hardware consists of a forward radar a camera four camera and 360-degree ultrasonics that go out to about five meters or roughly sixteen feet around the car so that allows us to do a work call sort of highway autopilot as well as some cool features like auto park and being able to summon the car in on private property I'm actually just I'm testing the the latest version of autopilot every week in fact I've typically two or three builds per week that I'm testing in my car we're making gradual progress towards what I'd say is a releasable bit of software but it is quite a tricky thing and we want to make sure that testing is exhaustive before we release the software but if if we keep making progress I think we may be able to get it out to early access customers which is sort of our public beta program around the end of this month so that should be pretty cool we also introduced the dual motor 70 kilowatt hour car and the goal here was to provide an Olin package that offered great value for money so all inclusive was all-wheel drive super charging what a pilot apart from the convenience the convenience features but navigation and so forth and it was intent to provide it factors that even if you bought the base car with no options you would still have a great great product that was the goal with the 70d and that's been very well received by by customers and we're seeing sort of upwards of a third of customers choose the 70d so this is sort of interesting terms looking at the North American market share of high-end premium sedans were actually the number one seller so we're so we're really excited by this because if we can take this level of success and extend it around the world there's really a lot of potential for sales growth look for the company and I think even in North America while we are strong on the west coast and in the south we are not that strong in the Northeast so there's really a lot of potential in the US Northeast and and within Canada broadly and we're also going to be opening up in Mexico later this year so yeah properly be North American so so I think there's this potential there to to grow things and yeah so this this is I think a great indication and as we as we bring out new models in you know in the Model X and the SP SUV category obviously and and then more affordable cars this bodes well for being able to replicate this level of share for for Tesla in other product segments um so with with the Model X the long-awaited Model X so we're expecting to begin our first liveries in probably about three or four months and as we as with the software I'm I'm looking at the latest iteration of the Model X every week and it really is it's turning out to be a really great car I think the Model X may arguably be a better SUV but then then the Model S is a sedan so that I think is really really exciting we want to make sure obviously that's that some of the key features of the Model X particularly the felt going door and the the way that the second row seats are done and a few other things that people aren't aware of are done just right and provide true functionality and true a true value improvement and you know versus just sort of feeling gimmicky it's got to be a genuine improvement in utility and aesthetics I think for it to be right so getting those the spinal nuances right for the Model X is is what we're focused on right now but we're really in the short strokes with getting this tube to market supercharges have really grown growing rapidly I mean sort of like help on steroids here yeah when we launched the Model S in just three years ago there were no superchargers anywhere in fact we didn't even tell people there was such a thing as a supercharger people for the first six months of the car bought the car not even knowing that there was they were going to be superchargers and we'd actually put a high voltage DC bypass in the car people didn't even know was there so we opened the first two super charges I think early in 2013 it's only been like two years and now you can travel almost anywhere in the u.s. using the supercharger network and and then going to sort of next year that's next year so it's a lot so you can see that that's from from zero to two that in three years and a similar level of density is going to be the case for Europe as well as Asia and but you know eventually you'll be able to go anywhere in the world using a supercharger network and and we're planning on to further upgrades to the supercharger system we've just introduced an upgrade which is a liquid cooled cable which means that the cable can be really thin in fact we have the first working version of that here at the at the Mountainview supercharger location so you can try it out for yourself it has caused some customers to be quite puzzled that they're plugging in a supercharger with this tiny cord and they thought something was wrong but that's actually just our next-generation cord because if the court is liquid cool you can actually make it very very thin and supple so instead of trying to wrestle it sort of a good-sized snake into into the car it's this thin supple cord it's really really great and it also has the potential for increased power of the supercharger long term so and then recently we announced the official creation of Tesla energy with the power wall and power pack and being available in two sort of configurations one as kind of a backup UPS capability and then the other as a daily cycler there was a bit of confusion in the press because they were conflate sometimes the backup functionality of the UPS functionality with the daily cycler functionality but then they're really two different things the daily cycler is sort of more about economics or getting off the grid completely whereas the backup UPS is just there to ensure that your house has power if there's ever a power outage and and and we did get obviously if ever to feedback on on the power wall a lot of it was positive and some of it was lots of positive but we actually took some of that some of the negative feedback to to Hart and I'm very happy to announce that the we've dramatically increased the power capability of the power wall so it's actually going to go from that from being from having a two kilowatt steady three point three kilowatt peak to a seven kilowatt power five kilowatt steady prices unchanged so it basically will more than double the power output of the of the power pack and the price is going to stay the same we're also prioritizing delivery of the power wall to people that have a solar installation doesn't need free solar city any solar installation that's compatible Susilo studies of course for I mean you know preferred if you like the best but but it basically if we're going to prioritize delivery the power wall to people that have an existing solar installation or or are getting a solar installation because the solar installation comes with an AC to DC inverter which means you don't need to buy an additional AC DC inverter for the power wall and because that that cost is already there with your solar system and and we're also going to be prioritizing delivery the power wall to partners that minimize the cost to the end-user so that the net result is we're expecting people to be able to purchase and install a power wall for about four thousand dollars so so that's that basically $3,500 for the for the powerwall with the increased power capability and then figure 500 bucks of installation labor and cost that's the best expectation so I think that dramatically improves the capability of the power wall and improves that and reduces the effective cost to the end-user so I think that the value for money is dramatically better with what we're with the changes that we're going to make so and of course this the power pack which has been very well received by the utility industry which we open up a new castings in machining center in Lathrop which is basically near Stockton it's out in the Central Valley so we're going to be doing a lot of machining and casting a lot of foundry work and producing a lot of parts that will go into the Model S and and that will be done in in the Central Valley so that that allows us to expand our vehicle capacity in Fremont and allocate more space for vehicle final assembly we also installed a new stamping press line in in Fremont and this is going to be have greater automation and it's going to be great for particularly for the Model X stampings and we're bringing up the the new sx of body production line which has also a lot more automation greater flexibility and we should be able to do at least within the body line about three times more than we're able to do in the in the current body line so it's what the whole Factory but at least for this element of vehicle production we will have approximately a three X increase in capability we also have a new pain center this is quite a huge capital cost for us and the new pain center is actually set up to be able to do ten thousand cars a week so this pain center is intended to be able to match the production level that includes the model three so we can produce all of the group we can paint all of the cars at the basically five thousand unit per year level with this paint shop and the best of my knowledge this is going to be the most advanced to the paint shop in the world and then the gigafactory making good progress with the gigafactory there's there's a lot of people bloggers online and so forth that will take photos and videos and drone videos of the gigafactory so it's pretty easy to monitor the progress search the internet and and we've made quite you're quite good progress here we expect to have phase 1 builds and operating and producing battery packs by the middle of next year all right with with that I think it's been a really great year I'm very proud of the the tesla team for everything they've accomplished and there's often a lot of attention out on me but really it's a huge team effort social nice to have been clearly proud of the test the team for everything they've accomplished over this period of time and there's this one one final thing I wanted to announce is that our CFO Deepak who Joe D are you right here do you mind coming up so Deepak is actually going to be retiring later this year and I wanted to just calling up on stage and to personally thank Deepak for doing an incredible job over the last like seven years it's been through hell and high water and and staying sort of calm and steady through some incredibly difficult times and yeah just thank you very much for everything you've done deep bucks going to be staying on through Walden for as long as it takes to to find someone to find a new CFO and then we'll be working with the new CFO to make the transition so bees should be a very smooth process but I wanted to just bring Deepak Deepak up on stage and just personally thank him for everything he's done for the company he's done an amazing job thank you well this makes it even more emotional firstly you know and thank you very much it's been an honor working for you I have discovered more potential in myself than I could have imagined and the credit goes to you for that it's been quite a remarkable journey for me of self-discovery as well as very fast rollercoaster ride I probably probably can do what we would experience in the Hyperloop when that comes to reality and so as you can imagine leaving or making that decision to leave that's well it's been really hard for me it's it's akin to letting go of your own baby is how I look at it because I've been in Tesla since 2008 when we had we started a lot of passion a lot of a vision to go change the world but limited resources and and we had to fight the battles to get there so it's been much harder than I thought it would be to be here and make that decision but it's the right one for me at this point to go check off a few things on my bucket list and pursue a few other life goals that I have I'm actually quite speechless and I'm going to just again thank you everybody and I'll miss this incredible passion of our customers and our shareholders and the incredible Tesla team so thank you alright thanks again you punk and with that let's open it up to questions okay if we can have people queue up behind the microphones we'll take your questions in the order that they come we'll alternate between sides of the room and obviously remember the the rules that our general counsel mentioned at the beginning of the meeting and blankenship shareholder and my question really is do you have any questions for us uh uh I mean we're always lobbing questions at you but you know would you is there anything you would like to ask us about the future or how Tesla plays into what we want from the future uh sure uh what do you think yeah uh I mean what do you think we should be prioritizing what I'm thinking more of is like Tesla is about the future and I think it's about what we want from the future and like what we were talking about today with the vegan Interiors I think that really resonated with me and it shows what people want from the future I guess they want a company that is like really focused on looking ahead like not just the car but looking at the future of the future and I think that's what Tesla shareholders are that's that's what our mindset is and so you know I just want some feedback from you essentially just like brain candy like when we leave here today what would you like us to think about in terms of the future sure well I mean I call the Tesla it's pretty straight forward it's really to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy and particularly sustainable transport so in order for humanity have a good future or for life on Earth really to have a good future we have to figure out how to make that future sustainable meaning not to have crazy amounts of co2 in the atmosphere and and you know ultimately get into situation of hydrocarbon scarcity which would be economically disastrous so the that that's what we're focused on that's our primary goal is accelerate the advent of sustainable transport and then with the batteries help sustain help accelerate the events of sustainable energy production so yeah I think anything that furthers that goal you know we'd love to hear about right for sure of making the cars compelling making it more affordable same thing with the energy storage products those are those are key things so if there's ways for us to make the car better or the batteries better we would love to hear about those hello mr. musk during the Tesla energy announcement you indicated that the gigafactory would be like a product and that you would continue to improve on it and open up the designs but as you've also noted there's a need for multiple Giga factories so I was wondering if there's any indication that Tesla would accept orders for Giga factory or be looking to build more sooner rather than later thank you well we go to build one first so I'm not focused right now it's just making sure that we both gigafactory version one correctly and that's that's going to be quite a quite a difficult challenge over the next few years we'll have the first part of an active next year but then we want to try to get to full production in roughly three years or maybe a little roughly three or three or four years so that's a that's going to be quite a challenge and I think once we get to that point we're going to be actually before we get to that point we want to figure out where to put say Giga factory 2 & 3 but but I don't think we should until we until we feel we've got a firm handle on Giga factory one we don't want to spread our energy over multiple efforts yeah this very brisk Armen shareholder a Model S and roadster owner I was very excited with your presentation and launch of Tesla energy but a specific question about the power wall I you reiterated earlier today two different models and I understand that I assume one can in a residential installation combine both types of power walls to a single inverter the power wall software can manage those but can the in an emergency situation like a grid blackout does the software only draw a back out car from the 10 kilowatt hour model or would it ever in some circumstances draw from the 7 kilowatt hour well the combining them actually wouldn't be super super great it's going to be yeah I mean right we actually we could make the software do that but it doesn't currently do that it would treat them both it's simply going to treat it if you had a 7 out of 10 like a 17 kilowatt hour system and depending upon what your draw is it would currently I believe draw equally from both maybe JV should join me on the stage grants of some of these questions but I think it really depends on what the application is that that you'd want to use it for it I mean it usually it tends to bifurcate quite clearly into either a backup uninterruptible power supply for the house or a daily cycling application in the u.s. the daily cycling application is going to be fairly limited because the the time of day charges are usually not substantially different I mean there are at a few places but in most places in in the US people have charged something clipping either a flat rate or something very close to a flat rate so so it's it's in terms of economics it's going to make more sense to get that you okay back on save so any wait so it's it like in terms of economics is can make more sense to it well actually basically it's at most parts of the US it doesn't make it what's what Solar City said which was one sent over in the press was in most parts the u.s. it doesn't make direct it doesn't make economic sense like purely a purely economic sense too you have a battery pack because in most places in the US you can't arbitrage your time of day use now in many other countries you can so in places like say Germany or Australia but the daily cycler pack makes does make a great economic sense it's like an awesome thing even if you couldn't care less about renewable energy in the u.s. you'd really have to care a lot about renewable energy all that life you'd have to care about it more than economics in order to do the daily cycler thing then separately does the intra uninterruptible power supply application which again we're probably not a huge number of households that want that but but it is nice to know that in if there's a big storm or earthquake or hurricane that you will have power and and that's that's the application so that's that's really one would be paying to have that capability and then with the increased power capability of the power wall that it just talked about you should be able to with a single 10 kilowatt hour pack being a with a peak power capability of seven kilowatts be able to put everything in your house except air conditioning on that circuit and then if you have a if you want to put air conditioning as well you can have two of them because we typically be about 14 15 kilowatts inclusive of air conditioning control and you can stack even more if you want maybe one thing also I think that it gets forgotten is that the backup battery can also cycle quite a lot you know it can cycle once a week for ten years so the cycling difference between the two is maybe maybe a four or five to one difference but people should never be afraid to actually use the backup version kind of in a hybrid application where you could be still cycling it quite often thousands of times and you also you know with the backup pack or the cycling pack I mean it legitimately lets you use more of the solar energy that you generate at your house you know instead of exporting it to the grid selling it essentially to utility and then having to buy it back you're legitimately storing your own energy and then using your own solar energy for your loads yeah I mean it to be precise I mean the the so-called sort of low cycle thing would be like roughly twelve hundred cycles and the high cycle will be five thousand cycles so if five thousand cycles if you do a daily cycle that's about fifteen years but even you know the the twelve hundred one that's you know it's what which one quarter so you could do it you could conceivably do a daily cycle for maybe three or four years even with that all right that may be like an overly comprehensive answer of it and actually it's probably worth also elaborating on the the power pack which we expect most of our activity to be with the power pack not the power wall so it's probably eighty percent maybe more than that of our total energy sales likely to be at the power pack level two utilities and two large industrial customers and and that's that's where the economics are very compelling because there's an important difference between price and cost the the cost to the utilities of up between day and night is quite substantial because the the power usage is often sort of a two to one at least if if not greater than two to one sometimes substantially greater than two to one between peak day usage and trough night usage so so that there's no question that at the utility side their cost of power generation has a big difference between day and night that that's a separate question from whether they are pricing that as such to the consumer and since the cost is fundamentally there between day and night for utilities it's quite compelling to use the power pack and that they can look at it from a levelized cost of energy standpoint and say well they could either get the key either sort of upgrade an existing power plan or they could get a new power plant or they could get a battery pack and they can look at it in a really simple way like that and the potential is there is noise in fact I mean even if renewables were not part of the picture that the power pack is independent of renewables you can actually take probably something somewhere close to half of all the power plants in the world and turn them off if you had batteries so not sure this is sort of well appreciated yeah in the whole distribution system all the wires all the transformers all the substations you know don't run anywhere near full utilization so you know as you kind of optimize that whole system you can get much more value the utilities can get much more value out of the entire grid without having to build more wires or buy more transformers they can just level eyes the load across the whole system and that all happens you know somewhat separately from renewable energy and it can happen in different locations exactly and there's another key advantage of the lithium-ion is that it's it's very compact so it's in a very tight package as compared to some of the other battery solutions which although they have a theoretically low cost per kilowatt hour although it's a theoretically low because they're actually quite high but but they're bulky and being bulky is it's really difficult because if your utility and you want to put and you want to add a battery buffering to the grid and then you and you can with the Tesla solution you can put that in at the substation level so you can take our car packs and they're compact enough to fit in an existing substation this is a very big deal because it means that they do not have to create a new substation or expand the existing substation because in most neighborhoods in order for for them to do that they would have to buy someone's house and level it and and put a new substation and then the neighbors do not like that so it's big big pain in the butt factor whereas if you can put the batteries in the existing substation it's very easy and it's a turnkey solution and and even being a big corporate customers they like plug-and-play like if it's if it's a low headache super easy order it install it it just works that they love it just as much as consumers do Alon as you probably hear every day thank you so much for all the amazing things you have done and are doing my name is Salim I live in Albuquerque New Mexico if I may respectfully submit a plea that many time comes for you to think of installing a second Giga factory her as opposed to the states you are considering as candidates you could become part of the hearts and history of New Mexico also sure we had the certainly Albuquerque was one the finalists so that would be you know a strong contender you know some of the other states there are lots of things going for them for New Mexico if you did this you could be what Microsoft and Boeing did so I hope you will consider that we'll definitely consider thank you thank you for letting me speak course absolutely my name is hidin so nod I'm a shareholder and I'm finishing up 10th grade tomorrow down in LA and one of the really things I've noticed about the majority of tesla's is that they're really not being utilized too often they mostly just sit around with just like they just mostly sit around so what what I've been able to do due to some pretty fortunate investments I've been able to order in 85g and what I really hope to do with this car is use it to its full potential and I'm going to be doing this by I'm going to be creating a constant loop of this car with constant people filled in it and it's going to be going between Culver City and Las Vegas and I call this a test loop and okay and by doing this I assume I can save around 40 tons of carbon dioxide emissions into the air every month by these cars so my question is mainly about thank you so my question is about autopilot in version 7 I want to know that if I do lend out the car people to drive it from LA to Vegas if autopilot will be good enough to really ensure their safe travels over the road and on the highways but specifically and also I want to know if you're planning on you planning on linking the sensors and the current Tesla's to other cars in the road and then lastly I want to know if you are going to be open sourcing the hardware and software for autopilot like you did with the electric designs yeah so the autopilot at least version 1 what a pilot the expectation is that someone is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over if there is an issue it's it's really intended in the same way that autopilot for an aircraft works where auto pilot for an aircraft alleviates pilot workload but the pilot is still expected to pay attention and so you can't like turn on the auto pilot and go to sleep and then that that is certainly true of the auto pilot that we'll have in in the long-term we'll have I mean sort of several years from now there will be a fail operational order pilot with redundant sensors and everything that's needed for someone to actually literally go to sleep and wake up their destination but this is an extremely difficult engineering project and it means you have to take care of all of the corner cases and there are there are many corner cases that the real question for what a pilot is not can you you know is it going to work it isn't going to work but how many nines of reliability so and and half and how much safer doesn't need to be then a person driving before you before the autopilot can take control with with no no attention from a person so I mean I think probably we'd want auto pilot to be at least statistically ten times safer than a person before we would suggest that someone simply turn on autopilot and wake up their destination so autopilot version one is really intended as a load alleviation for the driver and there's something that's sort of just it makes it easier to to drive but not one where you can not pay attention and and then as far as vehicle to vehicle communication there there is a little bit of that that will be done in terms of figuring out say traffic data like traffic speed data so we can we can do better navigation over time so we can say okay how fast all model ice is going on this road and that gives us the ability to give get better navigation to to users but I it's hard to imagine much more than that because this is such a small number of model lists on the road and the vast majority of other cars are not Model S's so so you'd only be communicating so much sporadically yeah so and did you have a fight I was just are you going to be open sourcing the autopilot software hard work in general we don't open source our software because you know we were a little hesitant about potential vulnerability exploits so we use an open source operating system I think so runs on Linux but you know we we don't open source the application code so also you mentioned something about a beta for the auto pilot how do you how does someone get in to become a beta tester for auto pilot you have to be on the early access program thank you all right yeah thank you Mr mouse my name is áwillá andele I'm a shareholder I'm an owner as well over Model S first of all on behalf of the Bay Area Model S owners I want to say big thank you for the Mountain View supercharger that just opened this afternoon my question specifically has to do with the auto steer portion of the auto pilot I think it's a most anticipated aspect of version 1.0 could you shed a little bit of light on the timeline for that are you getting some resistance from the government is there some models is it is it something that is coming for sure and yeah ultimately win yeah I'm actually testing several boats of the order steer functionality every week and so there's it was or we make sort of improvements most weeks it gets better some weeks it gets worse I and it's it's it's a bit tricky because like when you do the I mean this is a very difficult thing to take of a steering and and we have to also consider like what happens if there's a hardware problem you know some hardware system fails in the vehicle or there's a can bus communication error or you know this just the debugging of a huge range of issues is very difficult and we currently only have a Ford camera and a Ford radar and the ultrasonics so there's not there's this limited amount of redundancy on the sensor front so I mean for Ford collision we you know we have the radar and the camera to provide some level of redundancy and the ultrasonics but but there's only one computer in fact there's a whole suit there's a whole bunch computers in series that are that are doing this if any one of those computers fails then the order share functionality would would fail but you know that being said I mean I I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll have orders to your functionality out to early access customers by the end of this month fantastic yeah that's wonderful yeah and there's no issue with the government that we have to worry about there's no issue with with the government awesome because the big because portly this is not an abdication of responsibility for steering it is it simply meant as a driver at a driver assistance feature yeah so like I said it's basically it's a lot like what a pilot for aircraft where a pilot still has responsibility for flying the plane but being able to engage autopilot just reduces the pilots workload substantially yeah well thank you very much that's excellent news thank you Elon were at about three o'clock mark so we'll let you decide how many more questions you want to take but just wanted to give you that time advisory all right I'll probably take another maybe four questions or so yeah thanks great hi lon my name is Stephanie downs and I'm with people for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or a shareholder of Tesla's and I have a question concerning our use of leather in your car interiors as an innovator Tesla has changed the public's perception of electric cars and you've shown the industry that sustainable technology can be cool we've heard a lot today about the environmental destruction of animal agriculture so I'm not going to mention in any rest of that other than I'd like to mention that regardless of anyone's dietary choices in the actual production of leather which requires that cow skin to be converted into a material that will not rot it has to be treated with massive amounts of toxic chemicals including formaldehyde cyanide and coal tar derivative derivatives so the same as not all electric cars are created equal neither are all synthetic materials and there are wonderful vegan environmental friendly rillettes that are currently being produced some of which are even made from recycled bottles so what I'd like to ask from you is there these materials are available and if we can connect Tesla with organizations that are producing these materials that are vegan environmentally friendly cost-effective would you at least consider them yeah absolutely if you can give the contact information to Jeb who's right there then we'll look into it thank you very much hello my name is David I'm a shareholder good today I have a question for you thank you I'm surprised more aren't wearing them the my question for you is I'm a nurse I don't get snow days and I live in the northern upper part of the United States and the model 3 is more in my budget the model 3 specifically but future cars are they going to be mostly or all of them dual motor the I think for the model 3 the the standard the base version of the model 3 would be single motor but it still had very good traction control like in fact even before we were shopping the dual motor our highest sales per capita in the world just it just when we all we had was a rear motor were annoying and and a single loop the person who as an individual who'd bought the most number of Model S's or what most lot of Tesla's could go to bunch of roses before that lived in or lives in Norfolk which is above the Arctic Circle so it's real important to emphasize that even a real will drive Tesla as long as it has the right tires it has amazing traction on snow and ice but I think in order to keep the car as portable as possible we took the standard version a car would have a single single motor but we would offer a dual motor as an option ok excellent thank you alright hi my name is Bob Weiner I'm a Tesla stockholder also the SolarCity stockholder and going for the trifecta my question it's not inappropriate but I'm curious if you have any thoughts about when you would take SpaceX at public particularly after you retrieve your rocket successfully on the next try I hope sure well yeah because SpaceX's goals are very long-term it's certainly longer term than the save the stock market typically you know it's like the the feedback cycle in stock market tends to be quarterly and like maybe they can handle a few years max but but but if you're talking about something really long-term like trying to build a city on Mars and and then you end up sacrificing profitability for a really long time in order to get there and build the technology that's reduce so I think it would be not super loved by the public markets you know so the I would expect with with SpaceX is that will probably go public once we have regular flights to Mars well I'll try to answer a few more questions I know I'm supposed to have like a board meeting after this for me so I look at the scope will go to 3:15 if you guys don't mind all right hi Soto Shenmue so from LA my question is on on the gigafactory you said not by 2020 that you're gonna have more less 500 units produced but that was before you announced the power wall and power pack is that including a calculation because you already supplied constraint with the demand so even with the 103 that I think they'll create bigger demand well have you calculated that or is it lower demand in the Power Packs or yeah the the gigafactory is is as currently designed is intended to produce about 50 gigawatt hours at the pack level and about 35 gigawatt hours to the cell level so we'll be pulling in sales from other parts of the world as well and that that should allow for 500,000 cars to be produced per year Plus have 15 gigawatt hours or left over for stationary the way it's looking at the station demand for stationary is higher than expected so we are looking at potentially expanding the awkward capability of the gigafactory to meet the the higher demand for stationary thank you hi lon thank you very much for the supercharger here downstairs I think it's not just for owners actually for shareholders going to sell a lot of cars as people see that going in and out of Google and places like that my questions are around safety and one is you know mono is of course a new bar for sedans what should we expect for Moto X because all the other SUVs have like high center of gravity and rollover is a problem those types of things watch would should we expect there the second question is I have a guy start up if you know as you log miles in autopilot and you have the statistics of lower accidents that I'm sure is going to come true where we're going to be able to get like lower insurance rates from our companies sorry I missed a second and the second question is as you log more out of autopilot miles over glass in Auto cars whether you're going to be able to use that or we can use that to get lower insurance rates from insurance companies oh yeah well yeah I think I think we should be able to I mean I think as we can show statistics on on accidents as a both I think it should it should translate to lower insurance rates and we'll have to work with insurance companies to make sure that they are properly factoring in the actual accident rate of the model and model s and the X because the our injury rate is substantially lower than I think maybe any car on the road but certainly it's if it's not the lowest it's certainly one of the lowest and and I forgot like an important announcement at 2:00 p.m. today we did our billion mile for Tesla so and how's motox looking in terms of safety sorry how's the house motox looking in terms of safety and romeo so model X I think will have the lowest probability of injury of any sedan I mean the tests have been completed yet but I think it's it's headed towards having the lowest probability of injury of any sort of any SUV and certainly the the low center of gravity with a battery pack in the flow pan is incredibly helpful because the role of a kit susceptibility is extremely low it's very difficult to get the model x2 to roll over and and we've completed our internal or almost all of our internal crash tests and it's it's shaping up to be five-star in every category and every subcategory length the Model S so so it's yeah in fact I think probably safety is not something we emphasize enough about the Model S and the X because a lot of people you know sort of they'll hear five-star and I think okay well aren't like most cars five-star well that's actually not the case only about 1% of cars off five-star in every category and subcategory solutely like if you see five-star most the time they sort of rounded up their GPA there so I it's only about 1% are it five sort every set care except car and then the actual calculation safety is is a physicist a Cistus it's a statistical figure which you can access on the d-o-t website but is not something that they did they'd like to promote but it's there and at least last time I checked the Model S actually had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested this is extremely important and not well not well appreciated so the it's that you can't be there isn't a safer car so it's really if you care about safety of yourself and your family and friends this is the the best choice Keith Lambert's shareholder on the announcement of the powerwall there was a mention about the zero emission vehicle credits and the question was unanswered and it relates to the swap down in Harris Ranch and the ability to make an appointment or get a phone number to make the appointment so you can do this well and as far as the expansion of these superchargers what is the lifetime of free charging per vehicle and is what is the accounting for it when you sell a car so yeah we have the basically the LA to San Francisco pack swap capability in place and I believe all Model S owners in this sort of California you know area have been invited at this point to try it out and what we're seeing is just a very low take rate for the for this for the packs off station so we did an initial all round of invitations we did basically like like 200 invitations and I think there were a total of four or five people that wanted to do that and they all did it just once so like okay it's clearly not very popular and then we them exactly well let's expand that invitation to all customers and but I would expect that that sample that initial sample group is they're all customers roughly behave like that initial sample group it's just people don't care about pack swap the the superchargers are fast enough that if you if you do your driving from LA to San Francisco and you start a trip at 9:00 a.m. by the time you get to say noon you want to stop and you want to you know stretch your legs I hit the restroom grab a bite to eat grab coffee and be on your way by that time the car is charged and ready to go and it's free so it's like why would you do the pack swap it doesn't make much sense but and we will pack stuff into the car because we weren't sure if people would want to choose to pack swap or not we thought people would prefer supercharging we weren't sure so that's why I will pack a pack swap capability in and you know but based on what we're seeing here it's it's unlikely to be something that's worth expanding in the future unless something changes for the superchargers as we said in the initial press release the super charges are are free it's basically free long distance for for life forever so free largest forever is is what the superchargers are providing now there are a few people who are like quite aggressively using it for local super charging and we will sort of send them just a reminder note that it's cool to do this occasionally but it's not it's it's meant to be a long-distance thing but but it is it is free long distance forever and it's basically built into the cost of the car and we're based on what we're seeing in terms of the economics it looks quite supportable and of course we've gone super fast with the superchargers so the most of the superchargers do not yet have solar and a battery backup but over time we're going to we're going to put solar over every supercharger where that's where it's possible to do so or if it's not possible to so make sure that we're purchasing power that is generated in a renewable manner so that the entire supercharger network is powered by by sunlight hi my name my name is Ilya sutskever shareholder I'd like you to say a few words about the auto pilot specifically when it will become a fully when what is do you expect the timeline for when the auto pilot will be a fool go to sleep in the car solution given the rate in which you see it's being developed and given what you know about and how quickly regulation and laws can change to accommodate that well I think from a technical feasibility standpoint I mean created for it I think it'll be technically possible in approximately three years so I think well I suspect we'll be able to achieve that in about three years now it will take some period of time after that for regulators to accept that that is okay too you know just go to sleep in the car so I would imagine it's some something like a couple years maybe three years I from one to three years I don't really know because it's not really something like control after it's shown to work and we can compile a great deal of evidence statistically to compare what the computer would have done versus a person over billions of miles and we show with height with we would have within a very high confidence interval that it's cool for the computer to drive you home so yeah technically likely in three years one to three years after that before regulators approve it but again that best but is not something in my control and it might vary by country and by state within various countries but that's the the rough rough timing that's my best guess right now but but it is interesting like what I've found you know with with the both narrow and deep AI is that with each passing year my estimate for when it happens gets closer this is you know both interesting and alarming like it's excited exciting and alarming so hi my name is Kelvin yoga and I'm a shareholder I'm also a member of the I Triple E microwave symposium which takes place in San Francisco next year one of our main missions is to encourage young engineers and university students to get involved with engineering so what we've been seeing recently is that kind of a drop-off in interest among diverse groups as well as women in engineering which starts around middle school range so I was wondering if you could comment on any activities that Tesla is participating in or conducting in terms of helping education and inspiring young people to get involved with engineering well I mean we do cool products that require engineering so hopefully that's a reason like people think I think maybe they'd like to work for Tesla Tesla's kind of an engineering centric company so maybe that would encourage them to do engineering but I it is super important that tells us stay focused on the goal of accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and sustainable energy there are a lot of things that we could do that would be all these awesome social goods but if we if we divide our energies over many social goods we risk accomplishing none of them so so we've got to stay focused on this fundamental good that we're trying to achieve as a primary thing and then you know once we sort of are over the hump in particular once we have like a mass-market affordable electric car that's great then I think we can start to try to do other things but we really need to stay focused on that goal from are you presently participating in the university related research or involving institutions of learning in your product development yeah I mean we have relations with a number of universities and number of research groups particularly as it relates to improving battery cell chemistry so it certainly encouraged groups that are making advancements in any any technology that improves cars electric cars or autonomous driving to get in touch with Tesla and see if there's something some way to work together I would also like to thank you thank you and invite you to speak at our conference next year thank you card Thanks I think we'll do the fact that the last question all right what was that flash board yeah you you've gone well over the time you're so you're late for your next meeting all right that's it thank you everyone",Tesla Annual Shareholders meeting 2015,2015/6/9,Youtube
10,Elon Musk,"Okay We can try. Okay. Yeah, that's not bad Yes, I get it. Yes, I get it, I don't know, three, whatever. Ha ha ha. Yeah, I give this an 8 out of 10. I'm in favor of nuclear power. I think it’s a In a place that is not subject to extreme natural disasters. I think it's a, new nuclear power is a great way to generate electricity. I don't think we should be shutting down nuclear power stations. Exactly. I think people, there's like a lot of fear of radiation and stuff. I guess, the problem is a lot of people just don't, they didn't study engineering or physics, so they don't, just the word radiation just sounds scary, you know? So they don't, they can't calibrate what radiation means. But radiation is much less dangerous than you'd think. So like For example, Fukushima, when the Fukushima problem happened, due to that tsunami. I got people in California asking me if they should worry about radiation from Fukushima. And I'm like, definitely not, not even slightly, not at all. That is crazy. And just to show this is how, the dangers is so much overplayed compared to what it really is that I actually flew to Fukushima. And, actually, I donated a solar power system for a water treatment plant. And I made a point of eating locally grown vegetables on T.V. in Fukushima. I'm still alive. Okay. The impact is greatly exaggerated. People don't know what radiation is, I've had people ask me, ""What about radiation from cell phones causing brain cancer?"" I'm like, ""When you say radiation, do you mean photons or particles?"" They're like, dunno, ""What do you mean photons particles?"" ""Do you mean, let's say photons. What frequency or wavelength?"" And they're like, ""No, I have no idea."" ""Do you know that everything's radiating all the time?"" They're like, ""What do you mean?"" ""Like, everything's radiating all the time."" Photons are being emitted by all objects all the time, basically. So um And if you wanna know what it means to stand in front of nuclear fire, go outside. The sun is a gigantic you know thermonuclear reactor that you're staring right at it. Are you still alive? Yes. Okay. Amazing. I think people just don't understand Yeah, just say, okay, how many people have actually died from nuclear accidents? It's like practically nothing, and, say how many people have died from coal plants? And it's a very big number. Obviously we should not be starting up coal plants and shutting down nuclear plants, just doesn't make any sense at all. Coal plants, I don't know, a hundred to a thousand times worse for health than nuclear power plants. It's not super funny. I don't know, like two or three. This is not an LOL situation That one's pretty good. Yeah, metronome. Yeah, it's, I dunno, a 7 out of 10. It's kinda true. Oh, man, is this Laika Or it's referring to Laika or something. Husband, yeah. Yeah, Laika didn't come back. TRUE Well, I think people do care. Yuri Gagarin's name will be forever in history. I think Yeah. eah, well, I mean obviously $6 billion is not gonna end world hunger. I mean, the reality is at this point the world is producing far more food than it can really consume. We don't have a caloric constraint to this point. So where there is hunger, it is almost always due to civil war, or strife, or some like, it's not a thing that is extremely rare for it to be just a matter of, lack of money. There's a civil war in some country, and one part of the country's literally trying to starve the other part of the country. Yeah Food is extremely cheap these days. I mean, the U.S. at this point, among low income families, obesity is actually now the problem. It's not, obviously it's not hunger, it's too much, too many calories. It's not that nobody's hungry anywhere, it's just, this is not a simple matter of adding money and solving it. Two. Yeah. The British Museum is, it's pretty great. I mean, admittedly Britain did take these historical artifacts from around the world and put them in London, but it's not like people can't go see them. So, it is a convenient place to see these ancient artifacts is London, for a large segment of the world. So I think, unbalanced, the British Museum is net good. Well, I'm sure that a lot of countries are arguing about that. It's like, you wanna make these historical artifacts accessible to as many people as possible. And the British Museum, I think does a good job of that. Yeah, I mean, well how are we gonna pass moral judgment on these things If one is gonna judge, say the Russia Empire, you gotta judge what everyone was doing at the time, and how were the British relative to everyone? And I think that the British would actually get a relatively good grade, relatively good grade, not in absolute terms, but compared to what everyone else was doin', they were not the worst. Like I said, you gotta look at these things in the context of the history at the time and say, What were the alternatives, and what are you comparing it against And I do not think it would be the case that Britain would get a bad grade, when looking at history at the time. Now if you judge history from what is morally acceptable today, you're basically are gonna give everyone a failing grade. I'm not clear. I don't think anyone would get a passing grade in their morality of, you could go back 300 years ago, who is getting a passing grade? Basically no one. Yeah. Exactly. Sure. A six, a seven. I always 'Monty Python,"" they're great. The ""Life of Brian"" and the ""Quest for the Holy Grail"" are incredible. Yeah those are serious eyebrows Damn I don't know. Hopefully not. It doesn't. There is no one competing with Brezhnev. Those are like epic eyebrows. Give it a six or seven, I dunno. Brezhnev, he had a flare for drama as well. Like you know German joke. Yeah I mean, when was the cheeseburger invented? That's an epic invention. Like, like wow. Or a burger, I guess a burger in general. Yeah, but everybody knows if you order a burger, or cheeseburger, or whatever, and you get tomato and some lettuce and onions and whatever, and mayo and ketchup and mustard, it's like epic. But everyone knows, if you order a cheeseburger, you know what you're getting, it's not like some obtuse, well, I wonder what I'll get. Fries are, I mean, great. I mean, they're the devil, but fries are awesome. Yeah, pizza is incredible. Yeah.It's great. Pretty much, sure. Six, six or seven, I suppose. Ha ha ha That's funny. Sure, I'll give it a nine. It's really true. I mean, it's true, how did they get away with it? I mean, dick pics are, I mean, just something throughout history. As long as people can draw things, there's been a dick pic. It's a staple. Consistent throughout human history.",Lex Fridman Podcast #252 with Elon Musk_Meme Review,2021/12/28,Youtube
