1,Donald Trump,"not pleasant I have to be honest Pleasant I said it was blood I had more blood I didn't know I I didn't know I had that much blood the doctors later told me that the ear is a place that is uh a very bloody place if you're going to get hit but uh in this case it was probably the best alternative you could even think about because it went at the right angle and uh you know it was a hard hit it was very I guess you would say surreal but it wasn't surreal you know I was telling some somebody you have instances like this or like a lot less than this where you feel it's a surreal situation and I never felt that way I knew immediately that it was a bullet I knew immediately that it was at the ear and because it you know it hit very hard but hit the ear and I also heard people shout bullets bullets you know get down get down because I you know I moved down pretty nicely pretty quick and we had bullets flying right over my head after I went down so I'm glad I went down the the bigger miracle was that I was looking in the exact direction of the shooter and so it hit it hit me at an angle that was uh far less destructive than any other angle so that was the miracle that was for those people that don't believe in God I think we got to all start thinking about that you have to uh you know I'm I'm a Believer now I'm more of a Believer I think and a lot of people have said that to me a lot of great people have said that to me me actually but it was uh it was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle and uh all because I put down a chart on immigration that showed that the numbers were so great I I love that chart even more it's a sign it's an immigration sign you I mean the amazing thing is that uh the sign I said bring down that sign on immigration and it was literally about an eighth of a second where it would be good and and after that it was going to be a disaster no matter which which way you were facing but it just had that that perfect angle which was exactly at this shooter very sad situation such a sad situation as you know we lost somebody that was great Corey who a firefighter a a great gentleman a great a great Trumper he was a a just a fantastic family and a fantastic man and a friend of mine came up Elon and said I'd like to give the family some kind of uh help and I said that's great he said do you mind I said I don't mind at all and he wrote out a check for a million dollars gave gave it to the wife and you know uh she said this is really nice but I'd rather have my husband back which is a nice thing for somebody to say to be honest she's she's great the family is great and we raised a lot of money for them and for uh two other gentlemen were are unbelievable people also they were hit really badly they thought they were not going to make it and they did the doctors in the Butler area I tell you they were incredible they saved the two and uh they were really hit tough both of them equally uh and we thought we my first question was because I heard bullets flying over me and I said how many people were killed because we had a massive crowd there a tremendous thousands and thousands of people and there was no land I mean it was just it was all people so I how many people have been killed because I knew there were other shots being fired and they said uh we don't know yet but some people have been badly hurt and uh I have to give the Secret Service sniper they call him or Sharpshooter but sniper because he didn't know there was a problem he's been he's an extraordinary shot obviously and he didn't know there was a problem and he was able to pick it all out within 5 seconds and he used one bullet from very far away I guess probably about 400 yards the shooter was 130 but he was on the he was on the opposite side of the field and the podium and he saw the the smoke and the flame from the gun immediately recognized it and immediately took a shot and it was one perfect shot from very far away and If he if he didn't do that Elon he would have I mean if he would have a lot of people a lot more people have been could have been badly hurt and killed so I I have to take my hat off to him because that's also a surreal you know he’ s been with them for 23 years and there he's never had anything like this and all of a sudden he has to act and it's a very tough thing to act and to be shooting somebody but he saw the uh he saw the gun saw the smoke saw the flame from the gun very far away I obviously has very good eyes he's got very good Vision which I assume you have to have in that particular work but he uh he took aim very quickly and it was they say it was approximately five seconds from long range one bullet if that didn't happen because the shooter had a lot of bullets he had a lot of a lot of cartridges up there with him so well you know I view it as two ways there should have been nobody in the roof uh there were people because there were so many tens of thousands of people there there were people that were seeing him and there was one woman with a red shirt and uh Trump all over it and she's screaming that guy's got a gun you know you saw it probably here well they're going to learn from this the communication between the local police who sort of had an idea and then ultimately a man lifted himself up to the roof could barely do it because you know he was pulling himself up and yeah he saw the man with the gun the man with the gun pointed the gun at him he thought he was probably going to get shot but you know he was like pulling himself up and because of that he couldn't get to his gun and he fell down actually very badly hurt his uh leg his ankle I hear very badly but but he fell down and he did you know from what I understand he did say there's a guy up there with a gun and the the shooting started very quickly after that I think it I think it four Force the shooter to go maybe quicker you know you're supposed to be a very good shot yeah my sons uh Don and Eric they they can't believe what happened but they said from 130 yards a bad shot would hit that Target almost every time they said it's like in golf sinking a two foot butt it's not a it's not a long shot the uh Secret Service person had the long shot he had a you know triple the distance actually so uh you know it was a a terrible thing look uh it it's hard I have to say this about the Secret Service when I went down and you know I went down based on I think they're screaming uh but other people also because people saw this happen you know you had so many people one of the Miracles was that nobody ran I mean if if a gun goes off the crowd control people showed showed us this when guns go off and it does happen in stadiums at a soccer match or some kind of a match everybody flees they call it a stampede like cattle but everybody and a lot of people get killed with those stampedes we had more people than you’d have at you know some of these matches or or these games and uh nobody left you know you had a small group behind us in the grand stand and that was full and  you look at it as it was taking place and normally they'd be running they didn’t leave they saw that I was hurt they saw a lot of blood and they saw that I went down and it's almost like they wanted to be with me well out front you had thousands tens of thousands of people you as far as the I could see you had people in Butler as far as the I could see and and uh and a lot of press too were you know many cameras on watching this it's what made makes it so different because normally things happen that aren't good but you never have a picture of it here we have all these cameras shooting it so uh you know sort of amazing but one of the interesting things was that you didn't have anybody flee you didn't have anybody Stampede nobody and there was some people behind me they stood up and they're looking like you know I mean I tell you you want to have you want to have them in a fox hall with you I want to meet some of those people because it's so different from what you heard but so so I was down but the Secret Service guys there were bullets flying right over my head you could hear them go whizzing and yeah and these guys came jumping on top of me you know a young lady Kate uh would jump they they moved so fast and let me tell you that took tremendous courage now there was a lack of coordination uh there was you know obviously everybody understands that somebody that that building should have been covered and yeah that would have been this it's like that would have been this spot you know what people think is when the uh local policeman who by the way you know he really uh he did what he was supposed to do he couldn't hold on any longer and then when he got his head just peeking above this guy standing there with a gun at his head and when he fell down again hurt his ankle very badly but he was making the calls but what happened is the firing took place very soon so what they think is that this guy ran to his site which he had all planned out with a gun uh he ran to the site and he started shooting fast and maybe that's why he uh well he sort of missed I mean you know he got could have been um could have been a much bigger problem it was a miracle if I had to turned my head yeah I would not be talking to you right now as much as I like you I would not I would not yeah that's right we'd be talking from a different place but uh it was a it was a you know it was a very terrible experience the the Butler Hospital they did such a great job uh the doctors were so good everybody was so good there was there was a mistake if if if somebody knew cuz people were hearing that you know there was just a bad feeling that there was somebody was around you know that story now it's been yeah and if somebody could have said because they've often times said you know like it'd be a lightning storm or something because I've done I think over 300 I think I did a lot more than that but we did a lot and often times they’ll say Sir could you wait 10 minutes please sir could you wait 20 minutes as the storm overhead or lightning or something right and that happens often and this would have been a perfect time for that to have happened but it it didn't it didn't get coordinated that was the problem or it is thank you very much I I appreciate it I didn't I don't think I didn't think of it I just wanted to get up and I want to stand up I want to let people know you know I felt I was good when when they were uh on top of me covering me actually very much covering me and and very bravely but uh I wanted to get up I said I want to get up and uh they wanted you know they had they have everything there they have they wanted stretcher I didn't like the stretcher and I knew I was hit in the ear but I knew I wasn't hit anywhere else they felt I was hit someplace else because it was such a lot of blood and they were sure that I was hit someplace else and they were saying sir you you you were hit in more than the air I said nope I was hit in the air I want to get up let me get up and so we I got up and the crowd didn't know what to think I mean this was so so many people and they did you could see they were confused they didn't know what to think and I wanted to let them know I was okay it was very important for me to let them know that and they went wild you you've seen the after they didn't go wild when I got up because they didn't know was I alive you really couldn't tell when I stood up before the hand before the you know the fist in the air uh they didn't know if I was alive nobody did and uh when I put the fist up they were they were just relieved and happy and thrilled and the place went crazy it was pretty amazing it was a it was a terrible thing but it was. it was it was that slide say illegal immigration saved my life you're right but had to be at the exact angle I mean that's that's a great one sa you know the the incredible thing though when you talk about the odds you had to be exactly at that angle but but the incredible thing is that the chart I used it less than 20% of the time it was just a moment yeah it's always on my left never my right and it's always at the end of the speech so here we have it it's on the right not the left it's at the beginning not the end and even the people that put it up they were unprepared and they did a great job they got it up immediately fortunately but I looked to the right and and the bullet and the bullet came whizzing by hitting my ear uh so it was amazing but when you think of the odds of that and you know that that normally you wouldn't use it normally I wouldn't have the thing and then you know it would have been a very different story it's it's very much I I say an act of God it's a miracle that it happened and I'm honored by it I'm honored by it well I was going to say how good the numbers were by the way we're going back to Butler and we're gonna go back in October we're all set up and we're the people are fantastic in Butler it's a big it's a great area great these are incredible people uh like the three that in the case of Corey kill and the other two the the families I get to know him a little bit and the families are great but we're going back to Butler and uh I think I'll probably start by saying uh as I was saying PR being so horribly interrupted but  no but the chart the chart was just a chart that in my last week we had the best uh illegal uh immigration numbers meaning stopping uh week we had the best uh illegal uh immigration numbers meaning stopping uh it was at the lowest you've seen the chart it's become quite a famous chart but that was the lowest point ever recorded it was a really um I mean I was very proud of those numbers and then you see what happened with these people uh kamala and Joe you see what happened they just let it go I had remain in Mexico policies I had all these different policies that was so good uh guys like Tom homman and Brandon Judd from border patrol all these are all people that they've been on television they say it's the best numbers we've ever had we had so many different Jacks patch and release in Mexico not the united we had catch and release in the United States we had it in Mexico we had so many things we had things where if people many people come in there they have contagious diseases we had everything passed if you have contagious disease I'm sorry but we can we cannot allow you into the country so we were setting literally records and uh I all I was doing is showing that and I I use it sometimes and in this case I'm glad I used it I can tell you that but but they were fantastic numbers but I'm going to sleep with that chart always I'm GNA I'll be sleeping with that chart that chart was uh was very important very important for a lot of reasons  I say it very simply they have to come in legally they have to be checked yeah because look Kamala was the border tsar now she's denying it everything that I do she she's saying she was strong On the Border we're gonna be strong well she doesn't have to say it she could close it up right now they could they could do things right now it's horrible uh no tax on tips and all of a sudden she's making a speech and say and there will be no tax on tips I said that months ago and by the way they had just the opposite you know they had not tax on tips but they hired 88,000 IRS agents and many of them were assigned to go get waitresses and caddies and all of this on tips they have a policy they had a policy they were really going to go after you and were really harassing people horribly and then all of a sudden for politics she says you know she comes out with with what I said which I think is terrible and I think it's also hitting them very hard these people are fake now they're also saying they did a good job in the Border we had the worst numbers in in the history of the world not of our country there's never been a country in history that has had a catastrophe like this we've had I believe and I think you believe this too you know you hear 12 million 30 I believe it's over 20 million people came into our country many coming from jails from prisons from from uh mental institutions or a bigger version of that is insane asylums and many are terrorists and I'll tell you what they're they're coming not just from South America they're coming from a Africa they're coming from uh stupidly and horribly bombing Israel October 7th they're coming from all over the world they and and you know you look at it's so sad October 7th because it should have never happened it's so sad when you look at Ukraine it should have never happened we have a defective government these are defective people and they're not people that should be running it but where you see it the best is the Border because you had you have millions of people coming in a month and then she gets up and she tries to pretend like she's going to do something she had three and a half years and by the way they have another five months that they can do something but they won't do anything it's all talk she's incompetent and he's incompetent and frankly I think that she's more incompetent than he is and that's saying something because he's not too good and secure elections that's right I mean what what's happening with crime and our police are so good but they're not allowed to do their job but I have to tell you Elon I hate to say it because it's such a downer to say it I hate to say it I hate it but you have a lot of people that just shouldn't be I think it's a much bigger number than you think they're allowing again they're allowing people from their jails and if you were running one of these countries where they're coming from you would have had all of them as an example Venezuela their crime is down 72% they're taking their drug dealers they're taking frankly their prisoners they're emptying out their prisons they're taking uh their criminals their murderers their rapists and they they're delivering them into  well they did on a much smaller scale you know it was a much smaller scale but this is a massive scale because this is being done worldwide but here's what's happening crime all over the world is down and way do you see the numbers that we have you know these this is migraine crime this is crime that's that's G to be and I saw it today in New York where somebody was knifed where they uh raped the girlfriend of a man that stood there watching in New York in one of the shelters and uh started pulling out the knives and bad things happen today but this is happening every day these are rough people these are people that are in jail for murder and all sorts of things and they're releasing them into our country and they're telling them if you come back we're going to kill you we're going to give you the death penalty or kill you so they don't want to come back but these are rough people these are these are criminals that make our criminals look like nice people and it's horrible what they're doing and and she's in charge of it because you know now she's trying to say she had nothing to do with it and she's such a liar because she was called the borders are the first day and it was on the headlines of every newspaper she's the borders and she never even went there she went to one location which had nothing to do with where the problem is you know went in and out I guess CU she was getting a lot of pressure but had nothing to do with the problem but she was the border tsar and you people can't allow them to get away with their disinformation campaign now she's trying to say that uh she wasn't she wasn't really involved and the whole thing is horrible she was totally in charge she could have shut the border down without him he didn't know what he was doing anyway so he wouldn't have even known what happened you could shut the border down he wouldn't even know the difference but uh the fact is that she was border tsar are but if you don't have to call her that the fact is you could just call her she was in charge of the border and the Border was the worst ever it's it's simply not working these are the people that Elon would not be the same man if he had to walk across the street and look these people in the eye these are rough people these are really rough people coming across and I know rough people and these are people that we don't want in our country and you know the Caravans are coming in and they're putting and and who's doing this are the heads of the countries and you would be doing it and so would I and everyone say oh what terrible thing to say the fact is it's brilliant for them because they're taking all of their uh bad people really bad people and I hate to say this the reason the numbers are much bigger than you would think is they're also taking the nonproductive people now these aren't people that will kill you we have enough of them but these are people that are nonproductive they they are just nonproductive I mean for whatever reason they're not workers or they don't want to work or whatever and these countries are getting of nonproductive people in the Caravans in many cases and they're also getting rid of their murderers and their drug dealers and the people that are really brutal people and they're coming into our country at levels that have never been seen before and I saw an ad just before I got on the ad I'm walking over here and I saw an ad by Kamala saying how she is going to provide border security where has she been for three and a half years for three and a half years yeah it's a terrible you don't have a country Elon if they get in you will have 50 to 60 million people from all over the world world not South America only you know we think of South America we think of Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala and Mexico you know the four but it's not that it's everywhere they're coming in from everywhere and I had to stay in we're already overwhelmed Elon it's we're overwhelmed you had to see the news tonight about New York New York and I love that place and what they're doing to it is horrible what they're doing to it and all the courts do is they try and focus on Trump okay let's focus on Trump who did nothing wrong I complain about a rigged election Elon what's happened is unbelievable you have from Africa uh from the Congo they're coming from the Congo and 22 people came in from the Congo recently and they're murderers and they dropped they they drop them they take them out of jails which is very expensive you know to maintain the jails although they don't do too much maintaining I can tell you but they take them out of jails prisons they take them out and they bring them to the United States they deposit them in the United States and say don't ever come back or you're going to be executed and they don't want to come back but they won't come back but but they're coming from Africa they're coming from Asia they're coming from the Middle East they're coming from South America they're coming from everywhere and there are a lot of it's just a so we're going to have just just to finish this up we're going to have the largest deportation in history of this country and we have no choice otherwise we're gonna have a country what they what they've done to our country think of it with with you know in Venezuela and in some of these other countries crime is down 50 60 70 80% and you would be the same you would have you would I'll tell you what Venezuela has not gotten rid of all of them they've gotten rid of about 70% of their really bad people their jails are about 50% uh put into the United States same with other countries some are 30% some are at 50% they're all different but the bottom line is they're all going to be at 100% why wouldn't you put a 100% of yeah and they're doing it right now while this third rate phony candidate don't forget I beat I beat Biden uh he failed in the debate miserably and you know some people said oh gee it's too bad it's too bad he did so badly or I did well in the debate you know the first night they said wow one of the people at CNN said that was the greatest debate performance I've ever witnessed and then two days later they didn't talk about that they just said he was bad but that's okay that's the way I get treated and I don't mind that at all what I can tell you is this we cannot have a Democrat we cannot have her she's incompetent she's as bad as Biden in a different look she hasn't done an interview since this whole uh scam started and and say what you want this was a coup this was a coup of a president of the United States he didn't want to leave and they said we can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way what they did with this guy and I'm no fan of his and he was a horrible president the worst president in history and one of the reasons he was so bad first of all the Israeli attack would have never happened Russia would never have attacked Ukraine and we'd have no inflation and we wouldn't have had the Afghan mess if you think of it and we wouldn't have had Afghanistan but we think of it you take a fewhose events away and we have a different world we would also have no inflation was caused by oil so I had a good relationship with Putin despite the Russia Russia Russia hoax that lasted for over two years just a hoax created by Hillary Clinton and uh Adam Shifty shiff some just bad people you know just sick people frankly I mean shiff Schiff is a sick person he's going on to end up probably being a senator it's hard to believe the whole thing is hard to believe but uh that you know they put our country in danger with that stuff too they actually when they make up stories and you have to fight your way out of it for a long time but I know Putin very well I got along with him very well he respected me and it's just one of those things and he would we would talk a lot about Ukraine it was the apple of his eye but I said don't ever do it don't ever do it it you know I shut down nordstream to that was the Big Oil pipeline the biggest I think the biggest pipeline in the world going all over Europe I shut it down Biden came and then they say I I you know I was I loved Russia I was a friend of Putin and I loved Russia no he actually said to me one time he said if you're my friend I'd hate to see you as an enemy I shut down his pipeline the biggest pipeline they were looking at that the fun and this this pathetic president gets in there and the first thing he did one of the early things he did is he shut down he he shut down Keystone XL pipeline which is our pipeline that would have employed 48,000 people pipeline workers shuts it down that was you know a massive job that Obama refused to allow I allowed it in my first week because it was jobs and it moved oil and by the way in a much more environmentally friendly way it's underground it's not a truck that catches on fire or a train that catches on fire but think of it he shut down the uh XL Pipeline the Keystone XL pipeline he shuts that down and he approves the Russian PipelineI know every one of them Elon I know every one of them and I know them well I know Putin I know president Chi I know Kim Jong-un of North Korea I know every one of them and let me tell you people will say oh this is terrible he said I'm not saying anything good or bad they're at the top of their game they're tough they're smart they're vicious and they're going to protect their country whether they love their country they probably do it's just a different form of love but they're going to protect their country but these are tough people at the top of their game and when they see a Kamala or when they see uh Biden sleepy Joe they can't even believe it they can't believe this happened the all the stuff that you're seeing now all the horror that you look at Israel they're all waiting for an attack from Iran Iran would not be attacking believe me you know when I was there and I say it with respect because I think we would have been good with Iran I don't want to do anything bad to Iran but they knew not to mess around Iran was broke because I told China if you buy from Iran oil it's all about the oil that's where the money is but if you buy oil from Iran you're not going to do any business with the United States and I meant it and they said we'll pass they didn't buy oil other countries likewise you want to buy you're not doing business with the United States and they they were at a point where they were they had no money for Hamas they had no money for Hezbollah they had no money for any of these instruments of Terror and it was amazing in fact there were articles when I was leaving which is hard to believe actually especially when you look at what's happened to our country our country is so bad right now it's such a different place we were respected think of it four years ago we were so respected to a point where when I said don't buy oil they didn't buy oil but they had no money and Israel would have never been attacked it zero chance and again I said to Vladimir Putin I said don't do it you can't do it Vladimir you do it it's going to be a bad day you cannot do it and I told him things that what I do and he said no way and I said way and you know it's the last time we ever had the conversation he would he would never have done I got along well with him I hope to get along well with them again you know getting along well with them is a good thing not a bad thing I got along well Jun when I met with President Obama just before entering you know it's a sort of a ritual and I sat down with him and we talked it was supposed to be for a very short period of time it turned out to be a long period of time I said what's the biggest problem he said North Korea I had that problem worked out very quickly it was nasty at the beginning with rocket man and you know all the different things but all of a sudden I got those some those were some epic tweets by the way no they were epic everything he said he said that he has a red button on his desk I said I have a red button on my desk too but my red button is much bigger and my red button works and then I called him Little Rocket Man if Little Rocket Man anyway here's the bottom line all of a sudden I got a call from him and they said they want to meet they want to meet me and we met yeah as you remember we met in Singapore we met also in Vietnam and uh I got along with them great we were in no danger but President Obama President Obama thought we were going to end up in a war a nuclear war with him and let me tell you he's got a lot of nuclear stuff too he's got plenty of nuclear he can do plenty of damage so he and I had a good relation you know remember I remember I met him and and we walked onto his land nobody ever walked onto his land before I walked on I wouldn't say let's bring up secret service again I would say they were thrilled when I did that I walked onto his land and uh it was it was an amazing period but we were not in danger with him because of me you know I always say that we have enemies on the outside and we have enemies on the inside we have some really bad people in our government and people that are and controlling of the people I mean I mention names but I I don't I really don't want to give them the credit but we have some really bad and I say they're more dangerous than Russia and China if if you have a a smart president a president that gets it we are not in danger from those countries because they need us and they need our help I mean we forced Obama if you think about it Obama and Biden and Bush to a certain extent in all fairness forced Russia and China together and if you're a history student the first thing you learn is you cannot let Russia and China align but then they also got if you take a look look Iran and they have North Korea that's you know they caught the Access of Evil in the old days you had the Access of Evil here we have a modern day Access of Evil these are powerful countries very heavy nuclear which is the biggest threat you know the biggest threat is not global warming where the ocean's going to rise one one8 of an inch over the next 400 years the big and you'll have more you'll have more ocean front property right the biggest threat is not that the biggest threat is nuclear warming because we have five countries now that have significant nuclear power and we have to not allow anything to happen with stupid people like Biden you know Biden uh did something with Russia uh there was no chance of him ever going and and when I left and then then after I left they started forming big armies on their on the border with Ukraine right and I looked at that and I thought he was doing that because Putin's a good negotiator I thought he was doing that to negotiate but but then Biden started saying such stupid things for instance he said that uh it can be a NATO Country Now put Russia for for as long as there's been NATO has said we're never going to agree to that and we go right up front and say that and we did things and said things through this president with a low IQ very low IQ he had a low IQ 30 Years Ago by the way but now he might not even have a IQ at all there is no there's nothing on the board that goes this long he said things that were so stupid that that that war would have been that war had zero chance of happening if I were there zero chance he was saying everything the opposite everything the opposite and it's so sad because many more people have been killed in Ukraine than you read about you don't read about how Bloody it is and how DES hey look just in the two armies you're lost a half a million people and and you know Ukraine's having a hard time Ukraine I don't know if you saw the article recently and it's true you don't hear the true story but if you think about it uh Russia's gone you know Russia defeated Germany with us and they defeated Napoleon you know they've been around a long time they're a big fighting force and it's very unfair and Ukraine now doesn't have enough men they're now using young men and very old men to fight and it's it we're in a very bad position and I'm not going to blame exclusively but but I can tell you I could have stopped that and a smart president could have stopped that it wouldn't have happened but we had a we had a man that actually made it it made it more prevalent it it it was so bad the words that he was using the stupid threats coming from a stupid face that that he was using I said this guy's going to cause us a war he's going to cause us and let me tell you it can lead to World War I that can lead to World War I the Middle East can lead to we have numerous places that could end up World War 3 right now for no reason whatsoever and one of the things we're going to do is we're going to build an iron Dome over us we're you know Israel has it we're gonna have the best Iron Dome in the world we need it and we're g to make it all in the United States but we're gonna have we're gonna have protection because it just takes one maniac to you know start something we're gonna have protection and we're gonna have why shouldn't we have an Iron Dome Israel has one some other place have one that nobody even knows about frankly but uh Israel has it we're gonna have an iron dome but you know with all of that being said to me that's so important the most important but with all of that being said the elections coming up and the people want to hear about the economy and the fact that they can't buy groceries because they don't have enough money to buy groceries the inflation has killed them food prices are up 50 60 even 100% in some cases and this this stupid Administration allowed this to happen and it's a shame and that's the thing that people most care about in my opinion they care about the Border a lot and we discussed the border at Great length it's nice to have a forum like this where I can discuss something at length and by the way you think Biden could do this interview do you think that K could do this interview they would take a pass you they could not so they don't need Elon they don't need Elon screaming out questions it's it's pretty sad when you think that somebody that does this for a living can't answer a question or is afraid to do an interview and in her case with a very friendly interview she's got all friendly interviewers is pretty abut but the big thing now is the economy Elon and as much as yeah I mean I view nuclear as the single most important thing but a lot of people don't a lot of people don't understand that but it doesn't have to if I understand that that's all you need because if I was President you're not going to have that kind of a problem but the the thing that they really is making them angry is what Kamala and Biden have allowed to happen to the economy it's a disaster with inflation the infl it doesn't matter what you make the inflation is eating you alive if you're a worker or if you're a a uh just a a middle-income person you can't afford you know four years ago five years ago people were saving a lot of money today they're using all their money and borrowing money just to live it's it's a horrible thing that's happening and we'll end that quickly I rebuilt our military largely rebuilt our military did a great job on it which was so important you know we had Jets we had Fighters that were uh and bombers that were 70 years old we we did a great job in that then we by the way then we gave 85 billion of it back to Afghanistan if you can believe it we gave them 85 billion you know they're one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world they're selling what we gave them that was one of the most embarrassing days in the history of our country but uh if you think about go let's go back to the uh the economy we have to bring Energy prices down energy started it the price of gasoline now your cars require too much gasoline so you know you're you have a good and you do make a great product I have to say I have to be honest with you that doesn't mean everybody should have an electric car but these are Minor Details but your your product is incredible but but the gasoline Elon is the the the cost of energy not only gasoline it's the cost of heating your house and cooling your house that has to come down it it's gone up 100% 150 and 200% and that has to come down when that comes down and we're going to drill baby drill you know they stopped Drilling and then they went back to drilling because they went went back to the Trump policy but if they won the day after they get into office we're gonna this country will go out of business because they're going to go to an energy policy that's not sustainable wind and different things you're not gonna have anything and and I know you're a big fan of the AI and I have to say that Ai and this is shocking to me but AI requires twice the energy that the country already produces for everything so you're going to have to build we're going to have to build a lot of energy if our country will be competitive with China because that's our primary competitor for this on the AI you're gonna need a lot of electricity you're GNA need tremendous electricity like almost double what we produce now for the whole country if you can believe it the waste is incredible and it's nobody negotiates prices uh you used to have a lot of people making Jets and you end up with two companies and they'll probably try and merge at some point you you I mean I I WIP through it like air for just a a thing like Air Force One one of the first documents they asked me to sign a general walk said sir will you please sign this document what is it Air Force One that's with Boeing which is basically two planes 2747s and the price was 5.7 billion dollar for two planes now now they're highly sophisticated they're even nicer than your playing okay but much more sophisticated very I won't say what's on it but they got a lot of stuff on it anyway but it's 5.7 that's that's a crazy number a crazy number but I said I'm not gonna pay 5.7 I'm not going to do it I said who made the deal Obama and his people I said well then I know the deal is no good I'm not GNA do it and over a course of about four weeks by my saying I'm not going to do it I got the price reduced by $1.6 billion do for the exact same plane other than we had a nicer paint job if you want to know the truth but for the exact same play I got I saved one and I said to Boeing man you guys must make a lot of money if you can reduce the price by that but now what I do hear is that they're going back to the uh Biden Administration and wanting big cost overruns you know because they see these Dopey suckers in there and they'll end up getting some of the money back but I shaved it by $1.6 billion dollar for the exact same plan and and you can now take that and multiply that out times thousands of other items the numbers are astronomical I’d love it you you're the greatest cutter I mean I look at what what you do you walk in and you just say you want to quit they go on strike I won't mention the name of the company but they go on strike and you say that's okay you're all gone you're all gone so every one of you is gone and you are the greatest you would be very good oh you would love it but you know if you look at ARG be happy by the way congratulations I just looked at the number of people that are listening to you and I chat we'll quote a chat but uh congratulations this is very good I mean it's great it's and and you're an interesting character you know the uh new head of a place called Argentina and he was he's a big you know he's great and he's a big maga fan you know that he ran on maga and he took it to an extreme too he ran on maga and I hear he's doing really a terrific job it's called make Argentina great again it worked out perfectly he came in he bought a lot of hats he brought over but he's he's doing a big job he really cut and I'm hearing they're starting to do pretty well inflation's getting down you know they had like 2,000% they had inflation like like not normal inflation they had the the real deal but we're gonna have that pretty soon we we have I think we have the worst inflation we've had in a hundred years they say it's 48 years I don't believe it I think we have the worst they don't include a lot of the items that should be included you knowwell well think of education so we're ranked at the bottom of every list of the top 40 we're ranked number 40 number 38 uh Norway uh Switzerland Sweden different countries are ranked good actually China is pretty close to the top they're a top six or seven but we're ranked at the bottom almost at the bottom 38 39 40 in other words horrible and yet we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world so we spend more and what I'm going to do one of the first acts and this is where I I need an Elon Musk I need somebody that has a lot of strength and courage and smarts I want to close up Department of Education move education back to the states where where where States like Iowa where States like Idaho you know not every state will do great because states that basically aren't doing good now you look at Gavin Newsom the governor of California he uh he's terrible he's does a terrible job so he's not going to do great with education but of the of the 50 I would bet that 35 would do great and 15 of them or you know 20 of them will be as good as Norway you know Norway is considered great uh you can name them I mean just they're so good some of these countries are so good but if if you go into some of these really well-run States you know we hav states that don't know what debt is we have states that are have low taxes no debt everybody working you know they're really well-run and maybe they have certain advantages in terms of location in terms of you know the land or the the sun the sun and the water and the whole thing you know there are a lot of advantages that some people but if you moved education back to the 50 you'll have some that won't do well but you'll have but they'll actually be forced to do better because it'll be a pretty bad situation but if you think about it you'll have some of these states I'll bet you'd have 30 35 States it'll be much better and you know what it'll cost less than half what it is in in Washington and these people don't care about students in these you know far away States and it would be it' be unbelievable well like California you know as we said it's it's a badly Run State I could go through I got so many friends that are in those States even if they're Democrats I hate to mention certain States but Illinois badly run with priter he's a he's a real loser but but you know some of these places are just deadly run but you know it's almost going to force them to run better and they won't do a good at initially but but can you're not going to do worse than you're doing right now and I would say that the cost you would cut your cost by 50 or 60% and you'd have a little monitor you know you want to make sure they're teaching English as an example you know give us a little English right it's actually amazing people moving out isn't it amazing to you as a businessman that they can even survive like Illinois so many people are leaving and you wonder how do they survive I mean how do they survive uh I saw where you left California and you moved to Texas Texas does a great job uh but you know I mean I just wonder how do these states survive when big businesses oil company just left California as you know and they moved to Texas how do these big States survive when they lose so many businesses and their taxes are already really high you know their taxes are among the highest taxes you you almost wonder how do they how do they continue on and in many cases the governors don't do a good job and they're crime ridden places you wonder how do they continue to just go on it's it's not it's not a good situation right you remember the area in California where they had that where I guess uh somebody had Sticky Fingers and they sto a lot of money and uh they went into a form of chapter and it was very nasty for a period of time but now it's probably the most popular place in all of California so so you know at some point something like that may have to happen but the problem is uh you can't penalize people that loan money to the state when you have incompetent people like a pritsker look the family didn't want him in the family business and uh then he ends up being governor of Illinois so you know what is he gonna be is he going to be a great governor and uh you know you have people I could name every one of them I got to know every one of these and some are very good and some are just horrible well the people that got hurt worst are the people that did it the way they were taught to do it all through you know their younger life and their their young life and their whole life the people that saved money and then they got no interest on their money and inflation destroyed them and frankly they were almost better off if they didn't do anything like that I mean those people have been absolutely decimated and we're going to bring those people back and help those people we've got to get the prices down you know when I look at bacon costing five four or five times more than it did a few years ago when when you look at some of the food products and groceries people go they can't believe it they used to be able to buy a whole cart and today you know a lot of people just don't have the money they go in and they can't buy anything they they look at yeah it's sticker shock they call it sticker shock right we set a record we set a we did more deregulation and more uh restrictions on all of the different businesses than any other president i c remember I had the rule for every one we put in you have to get rid of 10 or 12 and we we did radical cuts on all of that and a lot of that's being put back by this Administration and we did radical cuts on things that weren't necessary but we were we were all said you know we had the best economy ever maybe in the world and then what happened is co came in and we had to focus on that and nobody knew what it was and I always say I got good marks on economy good marks on Military we knocked out Isis we did so many different things we rebuilt but you know I never got the credit that we really deserved on what we did with with Co we never got the credit but uh we were if had that not happened the gift from China from Wuhan uh came in from Wuhan the Wuhan La labs and I always said it and it turned out to be right but had that not had that not happened we were set to start reducing debt we're going to reduce taxes further I gave the largest tax cuts and we were going to reduce taxes still further for Middle income people not only businesses but we did it for businesses because they're the ones that that's why we had the great job numbers but we were set to really start reducing debt and you know we we're sitting on the the biggest pile of liquid gold anywhere in the bigger than Saudi Arabia bigger than Russia and we were going to drill and we were going to make so much money we were going to supply Europe with oil I had stop the Russian Pipeline and we were going to supply them with oil and gas we were gonna we were gonna make a fortune and then uh the covid came in and we had to we really had to divert then what happened is when they came in you know we we kept a lot of businesses alive if I didn't do what we did we would have had a 1929 type depression but the problem is when bid came in he got trillions of dollars and just started spending it stupidly you didn't need it anymore you know we got over that bad period where it was everybody was dying and feeling you know it was it was just not a good period interestingly uh you know during his administration many more people died during his administration of covid than during my Administration and we really got the brunt of it but people don't realize more people died during his administration than but it diverted us from doing what I wanted to do but we had the greatest for you know almost three years we had the great and you know that probably better than anybody so many of your friends said to me the best years we've ever had in business were during the Trump years and and also said that uh African-American uh Hispanic American were so incredible they were having the best Asian-American women men young people without a diploma young people that graduated from the best colleges from from MIT from the Wharton School from all of the great colleges Harvard they were doing better and people without a diploma were doing better and everybody was was happy and then Co came and we had a we had the problem is they spent trillions and trillions of dollars they wasted they shouldn't have taken any money and we wouldn't be having inflation right now which is killing our country I agree how crazy is that where you have Farmers that are not allowed to farm anymore and have to get rid of their cattle and the whole whole world is a little crazy but it's largely taken its lead from us I I do say though I've heard in terms of the fossil fuel because even to uh create your electric car and create the electricity needed for the electric car you know fossil fuel is what really creates that at the generating plants and you know so you sort of can't get away from it at this moment I mea someday you might be able to but I do hear we have anywhere from a 100 to 500 years left you know much of it hasn't even been found yet yeah but there are tremendous like anoir I got anoir in Alaska approved Ronald Reagan couldn't do it nobody could do it everybody tried nobody could do it I got it approved the first thing that Biden did was unimproved it to get rid of it he uh ended it his uh his secretary went in and she ended it and what a what a disgrace that's andw that's bigger or they they think it could be bigger than Saudi Arabia in Alaska could be bigger than Saudi Arabia but they went in and they terminated it and I'll get it going very quickly because not only is it big for Alaska I mean you talk about economic development that for the United States I mean that that is they say bigger than Saudi Arabia or the same size and pure really good stuff and you know they ended so I think we have you know perhaps hundreds of years left nobody really knows but during that during that time will come around that will be very good you know it's very interesting uh you use the word global warming and today they use the word climate change because you know you have some places that go up so they were getting themselves in a little trouble with the the word global warming because not every place is warming some places are going the opposite direction but uh you know I'm sort of waiting for you to come up with solar panels on the roofs of your cars and on the trunks of the cars and it just seems like something that at some point you will come up with I'm sure you'll be the first but it would seem that a solar panel on on the roofs you know on flat surfaces on certain surfaces might be good yeah at least in certain areas of the country where you have the the world where you have the Sun but I would I would think and I have no idea because that's not my world but I would think that this would be something that would be interesting but you know the one thing that I don't understand is that people talk about global warming or they talk about climate change but they never talk about nuclear warming and to me that's an immediate problem because you have as I said five countries we have major nuclear and and you know probably some others are getting there and that's very dangerous that's where you need a strong American president because you just you don't want to have this proliferation but you have five countries and getting more you know China is much less than us right now but they're they're going to catch us sooner than people think they're way lower Russia and us are number one and I we'r sort of tied and China is far behind but they're developing at a level that you know you're not surprised to hear very fast it's G to they'll end up catching up maybe even surpassing but to me the biggest problem is not uh climate change it's not and and and everything's you know a problem but it's degrees to me the big problem is the nuclear power the power of nuclear is so great and when I talk about I'll prevent World I'll prevent World War 3 uh I will but but the truth is that you have to because this is no longer army tanks going back and forth and shooting at each other this is yeah a level of destruction and power that nobody's ever seen before maybe they'll have to change the name the name is just it's a rough name there are some areas like you see what happened bad have to Rebrand it we'll have to give it a good name we'll name it after you or something you know um no it hey it has a branding problem but you haven't been feeling so well lately and I'm worried about it what they've done to this country obviously  we just won the big case in Florida this was a Biden Administration did something that's never been done in this country and that's go after their political opponent me with this nonsense uh and just nonsense in the big case in Florida we won but they've always they always pick a judge and a jury and they use local Das they use the local U uh attorney generals like fonnie you know F spelled f a n i fonnie and it's it's all a big hoax and it's all run from there like in Manhattan uh the one of the top people from the justice department went in Ran Manhattan ran the state the Leticia James deal was run by a person from the Department of Justice Biden they've never done this before and they set up a very bad precedent it it's it's called lawfare Warfare it's uh it's a terrible thing never happened in our country it does happen in banana republics and third world countries but it's never happened and the incredible thing is it actually drove my numbers up because people see you know fortunately I have a platform like you or you know in all fairness like a conversation like this where I can talk about it and people understand I mean you you fight for election integrity and you end up getting indicted because you're fighting for election integrity and when the day comes that you can't fight for election Integrity you don't have a country anymore so what happens what happens is they went after their political opponent me now Biden's a you know close to vegetable stage in my opinion okay I I looked at him today on the beach and I said why would anybody allow him the guy could barely walk why would anybody allow him does he have a political advisor that think this looks good uh you know he thinks this looks good because it looks so bad and it's it's ridiculous I mean and he's been doing that for a long time you know he can't lift the chair the chair weighs about three ounces it's meant for children and old people to LIF and he can't lift it the whole thing is crazy don't have a president and she's gonna be worse than him because she is a San Francisco liberal who destroyed San Francisco and then as attorney general she destroyed California you talk about location and we're talking about the sun and the water and all there's nothing better than California she has destroyed that she was the original da she was the original in San Francisco she was the original attorney general in California what she has done to California is well you know better than I do you just left California for a lot of those reasons and what she's done with with crime with with cashless baale where you kill somebody I mean we have states there you kill somebody and they let you out right away I mean you you don't have to even put up and then they never find the people unless they kill again and then they let them out again our our country is becoming a very dangerous place and she is a radical left San Francisco liberal and now she's trying to protect now she's looking like she's she wants to be more Trump than Trump if that's possible I don't think it's possible but she wants to be more Trump than Trump yeah I want a war I you know she wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention and some of these guys are really bad right that just came out today she wants she doesn't want to build the wall even though the walls work walls and wheels you know in your business everything you do is obsolete almost well not the tunnels but everything is obsolete even your rocket ships they like a month later they're obsolete you find a better way to the only thing that's not obsolete is a wall and a wheel and the wall you know I built hundreds of miles of wall and that's why we had such good numbers I was going to add 200 miles we bought it we could have flipped it flipped it up in three weeks and they sold it for five cents on the dollar that meant I said wow that means that they actually do want to have open borders she wants to have open borders and now she's going like she's tough on the on the border it's such a lie everybody knows it's it's a disgrace that she can say it worse than Bernie Sanders he is considered more liberal by far than Bernie Sanders she's a radical left lunatic and if she's going to be our president very quickly you're not gonna have a country anymore and she'll go back to all of the things that she believes in she believes in defunding the police she believes in no fracking zero you no now all of a sudden she's saying no I I will I really want to see fracking the day the if they got in the day she got in she'll end fracking and by the way if people didn't think that the lunatics that that really believe in that uh they won't vote for it you know um like like the Palestinians and Israel she is so anti-israel and she's bad for both Biden actually did something that was impossible both sides hate him you know both sides that was a hard thing to do unification I think it's highly disrespectful and I say if you're a Jewish person or if you believe in Israel if you're a a person that you know is a very pro Israel if you vote for her it's worse than and Biden was bad but if you vote for her you ought to have your head examined and you see tonight I mean as we're doing this I'm seeing reports coming that they expect an attack tonight or tomorrow from hundreds and maybe thousands of rockets you know their Iron Dome as they call it as we all call it but their Shield that they build uh that can be uh swamped we'll use the term that's appropriate swamp but they swamp it by shooting enough missiles you know this better than anybody by shooting enough missiles they can't defend themselves you know they just obliterate the whole place and that's what some people think they're looking to do and we have no leadership there's no respect for the United States of America with these people and I'm telling you she'll be worse than him because she's a believer in being radical left and he wasn't well her uh her running mate uh approved signed into legislation tampons in boys bathrooms okay now that's all I have to hear tampons and boys bathrooms and that means she believes in that too I mean she she picked this guy because he was the closest to a lot of people thought she'd pick sort of the opposite but she picked an anti-israel radical left person but she is far worse they say than Bernie Sanders if we have her as a president if we have a Democrat at this moment as a president I don't think our country can survive I I think it's I think it's a massive I think I think we're in massive trouble uh frankly with with a Kamala Administration and that's my honest opinion um and uh and I I think uh I think really it's essential that that you win for the good of the country uh this election and I mean that's understating my opinion um now you know you may have seen this but I I got a letter from the the the EU commission like saying you know to not have disinformation on the like during this discussion that we're having like and you know there like there there's a lot of attempts to do censorship and t force censorship even on Americans uh from other countries and um you know what do you think about that well I know the uh European Union very well the take great advantage of the United States in trade as you know we u through a different Forum NATO uh we protect them and yet uh if you build a car in the United States you can't sell it in Europe you just can't sell it it's it's impossible uh the same thing with our Farmers our Farmers find it very difficult to do business you know we have a deficit with them of $250 billion dollars which people don't know it sounds so nice the European Union but let me tell you they're they're uh not as tough as China but they're bad and I let them know it and that's probably why they notified you no they don't treat treat our country well we defend them you know uh with Ukraine so we're in for 250 billion and they're in for about 71 billion and they have the same size it's if you add up the European nations that you know in terms of an economy it's about the same size wouldn't you say as us and they're and and and they're in much greater risk they they're right there we have an ocean separating us from in this case the enemy would be Russia you to be for the Soviet Union but let's assume they're close enough and what happens is uh they're in for 70 something million I think I think even less than that billion and we're in for about 250 billion and it could be a lot higher than that and I say why aren't you going to equalize why aren't they paying what we're paying and they're in much more you know they're it's much more important for them because of the fact that you know they're right near there I mean they're all sort of in that location we're not but they should they should and I did it with NATO we were there were only seven countries that were paid up in NATO out of 28 at the time and the United States was subsid the United States was subsidizing NATO tremendously subsidizing NATO and I said I went in and I said you got to pay up if you don't pay up we're not going to defend you any longer I took a lot of heat but you know what happened billions and billions of dollars came flowing in and and then we get taken advantage of on trade so think about it well you know when you talk about cutting and savings and everything else I mean honestly look there's nobody that feels worse about the Ukraine situation than I do because I know it would have never happened I know zelinski he was very honorable to me because when they went with the Russia hoax and they said I had a phone call with him he said it was a perfect phone call it was a great phone call he could have grandstand it and you know said oh he he was very threatening he said no it was a very nice phone call you I called him up to congratulate him on his win and you end up getting impeached because these people are lunatics you know I was talking about the difference from the people within and the enemies on the outside in many cases the people from within are more dangerous for our country than the Russians and the chin if you have a smart president you're not gonna have a problem with them you're gonna make you're gonna do things yeah now they've taken advantage of us incredibly but you're going to do things with the right person well the good thing is that you and I have and some people very few uh we can get the word out although sometimes it's hard because they don't want to print it you know like like we're having a great conversation right now Cala wouldn't have this conversation she can't because she's not smart you know she's not a smart person by the way she can't have this conversation and Biden we don't even have to talk about it I mean he couldn't have this conversation he he would have given up in the first half of a question he would have walked out he would have said where am I where am I going so anyway but no he wouldn't have this that's true not a lot of people would have this conversation but you know we cover a lot of territory but the beauty is that you you know we can have a conversation and get it out without because I get but think of it we need a man or perso who's unbelievably sharp in order to stop all the nuclear danger and all the dangers that I'm talking about and I got along with all the you know I got along with Kim Jong-un we had dinner we had everything and he he really liked me and I got along with him really well by the way he's he's the absolute boss over there you know a lot of people said oh do you think you really let me tell you I saw things that you don't want to know about he is the boss but we had a good relationship and and he doesn't like uh Biden he considers him a stupid man he said he's a stupid man well at least he speaks his mind but you know in this country you're not sort of allowed to say it but I guess you you should be allowed to say that it's true but we need really we need smart people and we need people that have an ability to lead and she doesn't have that ability can you imagine now you know chairman she very well can you imagine her and him negotiating or even standing together it it is the whole concept is ridic she is terrible she's terrible but she's getting a free ride I saw a picture of her on Time Magazine today she looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live I it was a drawing and uh actually she looked very much like a great first lady Melania she look she didn't look she didn't look like Kamala that's right but of course she's a beautiful woman so we'll leave it at that right they want the American dream back more important than anything else it's it's like you don't have that today because the people they've been just sucked they see incompetent people running our you know the the Biden thing is very interesting people just found him to be incompetent and when I debated him I was like is this for real it was well I saw what you did in Vegas and I'll tell you it was amazing I I got to see I took a big Glimpse at it and it's incredible what you you know it's incredible and you could do that all over you could do that all over it's uh it's deep yeah you don't even need much structure you know assuming you're in the right area and much safer than surface uh trains where there is a danger there you know with people with crazy people it's much safer much better and you know it's sad because I've seen some of the greatest frames I I find it fascinating and I've seen the systems and how they work and the bullet trains they call them I guess and they they go unbelievably fastunbelievably comfortable with no problems and we don't have anything like that in this country not even close and it doesn't make sense that we don't doesn't make sense I work very hard on that you know we got that down to to the lowest number ever and we got uh Therapeutics approved in the FDA that people can't even believe the speed but I I took them on I I don't think they like me too much but I got approved in the FDA at at at numbers that they wouldn't believe and you know it's a very bureaucratic group actually it's a fine group of people in many cases I got to know a lot of them but I was pushing them really hard for regenerant for so many different things that that were really pretty amazing but but the FDA takes too long they would it's 12 years to get a product approved I got it down to four and I got some things done very quickly but it's uh it's really something that is going to have to be worked on because it takes too long just takes too long you know Elon just getting back to the FDA for one second I got something done called right to try this is where you can go in and if you're terminally ill you can use a Space Age uh you know medicine or whatever it may we have the best doctors the best labs in the world we really do and but people would go to other countries because you couldn't use this the product even if they thought it worked because it's going through the FDA I got it approved where you can yeah you you basically look nobody want the doctors didn't want it because of the liability the country didn't want it our country because they didn't want to get sued these are people terminally ill the insurance companies didn't want it and the pharmaceutical companies nobody wanted it I got everybody into a room and we came up with an agreement that you won't get sued and also they didn't want it on their record if somebody's terminally ill and they die after taking a drug they didn't want that on their record so we set a second a separate list if somebody was so it wouldn't count as a negative okay and as you know we got it done we have saved right to try they've been trying to get this donefor 58 years and it sounds simple but it wasn't because you know I mean you know the insurance companies nobody wanted it but we got it done somebody signs you signed a document that you're not going to sue the insurance companies the country you're not going to sue anybody and we got it done and we're saving tens of thousands of lives right to try hopefully you never need it but if you do you don't have to travel to Asia you know people if they had money they go to as they go to Europe if they don't have money they go home and die that's what happened they'd go home and diewell we did it we did something that really they've been trying to do it for 50 years and they just couldn't get it done and I got it done and it's uh it's really something but you're right some people go to Europe because a drug isn't approved here but it's approved in Europe and it's a drug that generally speaking would work it's pretty crazy well I think just you know in sort of closing up and by the way I'm looking at the numbers you get a lot of people listening I hope you don't get nervous because you got a lot of people listening to you right now like 60 million or something what is that number it's crazy it's amazing how you can see that right away how many what is the number wow what is is it in terms people that's bigger than you said you you said 25 and you're more than much more than double that number 25 million I think you're going to be 60 or 70 and I guess over a period of time hey that's I congratulate you do I get paid for this or not but that's what they say yeah that's good well look it's an honor I but I I just asked this are you better off now or were you better off when I was President nobody's better off now people you know we put out polls on that and nobody's better off now inflation has killed it and you know they also feel very unsafe you look at what's going on with a lot of different things you look at the riots we had at the colleges over I mean ridiculous but all of the rights they just feel unsafe and now they really feel unsafe because you have a new form of crime it's called migrant crime I call it Biden migrant crime maybe I'll call it Kamala migrant crime but the only one that gets prosecuted is Donald Trump they don't get they prosecute Trump once they start this precedent because this can go on with the next one I mean this is a very bad precedent what they're doing in terms of you know going after their political opponent and that's all it is it's going after their political opponent and and then you get a judge who's you know a strong Democrat and I'm being nice when I say that in many cases crooked as hell but you get a judge and you go into an area where a republican gets three or four percent of the vote and you know you'll have a jury pool with uh people that hate Republicans or hate it could also be the other way though because it could start the other way in areas where they hate Democrats and you get into a Pandora's Box it's a very dangerous thing for this country and a very dangerous thing even for the state New York City is lo New York city and state lose a lot of business over they did to me because these people say we don't want that to happen to us that's no justice system you have an unfair system of justice and it's costing New York State a tremendous amount of money people are leaving and companies are leaving and they won't come back so you know all of that stuff is important but the economy now is the big thing and we can turn that economy up so fast and people are going to be back again we're goingto get rid of inflation absolutely absolutely so and I just want I want to congratulate you you've done amazing job you are you have definitely got a fertile mind you know we can talk you and I can talk about rocket  tunnels we can talk about tunnels and Rockets and and uh electric cars so many things and now you you're into the AI and that's going on to be another Beauty I'll say so it's h yeah it's an amazing it's an amazing thing you've done Elon it's an amazing thing and I congratulate you well I appreciate that that endorsement meant a lot to me not all endorsements mean that much to be honest your endorsement me a lot and you know we have a a phrase make America great again it's pretty simple but it really says that we want to make America great again and we can do it we can do it now but if we were going to suffer another four years like we've suffered for the last four years years I'm not sure the country can ever come back that's how bad it is it's so bad we have to we have to do a lot well I want to thank you and you know I actually always did think of you as somewhat left I must say that so it's uh it's even more of an honor to have your endorsement I know how strong you feel about it but you know when you think of her uh San Francisco 15 years ago I had a great friend Bob Tish he said it's the greatest city in America and now it's you it's not it's almost not livable there and California likewise and she was involved in the destruction of San Francisco and the destruction of California and she will be involved in the destruction of our country if people are so unwise as to elect her and I hope that doesn't happen and I hope the elections are going to be run honestly and we're going to turn this country around we're gonna we're going to do things that and we can do it fairly quickly and we have to get rid of the criminals that have been you know given to us by other countries as they laugh they laugh at us they think we're stupid to accept these people these are radical Stone Cold Killers in many case cases and terrorists and in our country by the hundreds of thousands yeah and we have to take them out 100% I I don't understand you know the whole they call it Progressive they don't like the word liberal anymore but call it liberal or Progressive I don't understand how somebody could say that it's okay for them to empty prisons into our country and again I told you their crime rates all over the are going way down which makes sense in fact the next time what we'll do is if something happens with this election which would be a horror show we'll meet the next time in Venezuela because it'll be a far safer place to meet than our country okay so we'll go you and I will go and we'll have a meeting and dinner in Venezuela because that's what's happening their crime rates coming down and our crime rates going through the roof and it's so simple and it's you haven't seen anything yet because these people have come into our country and they're just getting acclimated and they don't know about being politically correct law enforcement or lack of law enforcement and our police I I have to just end with this we have great police we have great law enforcement but they're not allowed to do their job they have to be able to do their job without being destroyed well even worse even worse they prosecute the police officer they they go after a and they prosecute the police officer and they take away his pension they take away his job he loses his family he loses his house I’ve never seen anything you know we see where they get shot it's very dangerous profession but something they're very proud of and they want to be able to do their job but I've seen them get shot I've seen a lot of but I've never seen where these guys are standing in the middle of a big street everybody watching them and they're literally boxing like punching stand up fighting a police officer there were two of them and you had about six of these guys and they're punching the hell out of them and in their own country they would be dead if they did that they'd be shot they would be shot instantly and you know they come from these countries and it's taking them a while to realize that we don't do that in this country but in their own country if they stood on a street and had a fight with a police officer they would be shot there's no political correctness and it's such a sad it's such a sad thing to see and that's the reason you have crime by the way because we don't do anything about it we're gonna change it and we're gonna get them out of the country you know when I first got involved they said you couldn't get them back to these countries you couldn't take them back in the case of uh Guatemala honduras El Salvador some others you couldn't get it back and I said really oh you can't get it back because under uh Obama he couldn't get him back they'd put up they'd fly him in and they' put planes on the runways in these countries so you couldn't land the plane they'd bring them back and the general told me the generals told me you sir we can't bring them back the countries won't accept MS13 gang members they won't accept them and I said really how much do we pay these various countries in terms of economic aid which is also somewhat ridiculous and the answer was $750 million I said good tell themthey're in default they're delinquent we're not going to do we're not paying them anymore because they won't accept it and you know what happened they all called me every one of them they said we would be honored to take them back sir we would be honored it was so easy but it's one of those things and we got it back we took in so many you know MS13 is probably the worst gangs in the world they're the most vicious violent we took them out of here by the thousands and got them out of here and their countries took them back and because I said you're not getting any more economic aid and once I said that they were they wouldn't take them back for Obama they wouldn't take them back for anybody and now we have a problem because we have this guy and they again they don't take him back anymore with the Biden because they don't respect him and we have to give our police officers the dignity and the respect that they deserve and we have to let them do their job they they can do a great job but we have to let them do their job and if we don't do that we you know it's it's going to all it's going to all disappear there's never been a society like this where you're allowed to do anything you want and nothing happens and I'm talking about violent crime and it's going to get more violent because these are really really violent people and we're going to get them out of our country and we're going to get them back to where because they were sent here by the presidents and by the various people that run those countries and I know every one of those guys and they're smart people and they're StreetWise people and they really think that the USA is stupid they think we're run by stupid people and they happen to be right but when I was there we had no problem we got them out we took out thousands of MS13 gang members we brought them back and now again they it's the same old story we don't do it and they actually gave them a big increase in a they they raised it up to billions of dollars and they get nothing for it so you know it's it's uh I hope everybody's gonna vote for Trump and we're gonna get this country straight and I didn't need this I'm like I didn't need this I had a very nice life I didn't need to to go through court systems and go through all the other stuff and run at the time I have to run I have to go through fake trials with in some cases corrupt judges totally corrupt judges I didn't need it I had a nice life I have great locations I have beautiful oceans that I have places you know I this was but I felt it was important and if I had to do if I had to do it over again you probably think I'm crazy for doing it actually but if I had to do it over again I would have done it over again because this is so much more important than me or my life this is we're to save this country this country is going down and these people are bad people that were running against and they're Liars they make statements they they they do things that are so bad they they say they're going to make a strong border they say they've been great on the border and they've been the worst in history they say they're great on the boarder stop well I appreciate we're going to make we're going to give incentive to companies to come into our country not to leave our country we're going to be giving tremendous incentives we want companies to build here not to build in other locations and we want to create jobs and again it's about the American dream you don't hear about the American dream anymore Elon you don't hear you're the American dream in the truest sense but you don't hear about the American dream anymore and you're going to hear about it people they need that incent initiative to go out and Yeah and do it and they they're going to love their lives I mean they're going to love they're going to look forward to getting up in the morning and going to you know going to a job that they love not a job that they can't stand or not any job at all where they have no money where they literally have no money and then they end up with violence and lots of other problems no we're gonna do we're gonna do some great things and I learned a lot in the first we had a great economy and all of that we rebuilt the military did so much but I also learned and I also learned the best people I learned the good people the the smart people the dumb people the people that can do things the people you know you learn when I first came in I I tell people I was in Washington DC only 17 times according to the fake news media I was in 17 times I never stayed over and you don't know people you rely on other people to give your names and then you realize the people you relied on weren't so good now we had great people but we also had some where I wouldn't have you know used them had I known now I know everybody and I think we're going to uh we're going to really turn things around fast we have no choice otherwise we're not going to have a country and I really appreciate this has been to me it's been a lot of fun being with you you're an amazing guy you've done an incredible job and a great inspiration to people a great inspiration and I hope you keep going and just uh continue to do well and we're going to have a big election coming up and I think November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country I think that election will be the most important election and I think it'll end up being maybe the most important day in the history of our country because if we don't win I just feel so sorry for everybody thank you very much Elon it's a great honor and we'll we'll do it again sometime and uh it's been  really fun and I hope you got a lot of I hear you got a lot of viewers but I hope you I know you got a lot of them so uh I appreciate it I'll see you soon all right",Trump Musk Call on X,2024/8/13,Youtube
2,Donald Trump,"well thank you very much they actually told me you can speak for an hour and a half so 30 minutes he didn't like the way I looked I guess this but we do have a lot to say and I want to thank you Bob and also want to thank friends and respected Business Leaders for welcoming me back to the historic New York economic Club historic indeed a very special thanks to Barbara Van Allen Barbara thank you very much and former director of the National Economic Council Larry Ludlow what J and former chair of the Council of economic advisors Kevin Hassett Ambassador Robert Lighthizer horrific person former secretary Wilber Ross former treasury secretary steven mnuchin former SEC chairman Jay at Clayton  Ambassador Woody Johnson Senior advisor Steven Miller my friends and respected Business Leaders all John Paulson Jamie Diamond Steve witkoff Steve schwarzman Scott Bessant Jeff sper Richard CTS former head of the World Bank David Malpass and the two co-chairs of my presidential transition team that are being inundated with phone calls and requests Linda McMahon and Howard lutnick thank you thank you very much as we gather today we have an econ an economic disaster on our hands we have an economy in crisis a failing Nation a nation in serious decline under the radical policies of my former opponent Joe Biden and my new opponent kamala Harris 1.3 million workers have become unemployed in the past 12 months I don't know if anybody knows that the typical American family has lost over $28,000 due to rampant and record setting inflation credit card debt has reached the highest in history with more than one in three Americans report reporting they have maxed out their credit cards they've maxed out families now need to earn an estimated $110,000 a year to afford a typical home meaning 65% of households are locked out of buying just an ordinary house gasoline prices grocery prices electricity prices mortgage rates and virtually everything else are up 30 to 100% since I left office 8.4 million Americans are now working second jobs the highest in more than 30 years the real wages of african american workers are down by over six% short period of time the real incomes from Hispanic men are down 6.6% or $3,600 per year and on top of that African-Americans and Hispanic American jobs are under massive threat from The Invasion taking place at our border they're taking the jobs of Hispanic Americans African Americans and nobody talks about it but I won't let it happen yet after presiding over the border the worst in history for any country there's never been a border like this 21 million people we project this total economic catastrophe the border tsar kamala Harris has now been slotted in by the Democrats to be reelected she wants four more years to enforce a radical left agenda that poses a fundamental threat to the prosperity of every American family and America itself and we're talking about America itself she wants to defund the police have totally open borders ban fracking in Pennsylvania and everywhere else take away your private health insurance and perhaps most pertinent to the very brilliant people in this room raise your business and corporate taxes and unbelievably she will seek a tax on unrealized capital gains most people don't even know what that means what does it mean she has been after all of this for years and as everyone knows she's a Marxist who destroyed almost single-handedly San Francisco and when she was the AG California itself not the same place people are leaving they're fleeing like they are in New York she'll seek out and she will try and get those things if she she's elected and she may very well succeed in getting them she recently said her values have not changed and these have really been her values for her entire career her values haven't changed that's what she wants so she told the truth we are not going to let this happen communism is the past freedom is the future and it is time to send comrade Kamala Harris back home to California where crime is rampant and fleeing is the number one occupation I'm here today to lay out my plan to rescue our country from this nightmare and to bring back to its citizens the American dream bigger better and stronger than ever before eight years ago I came before you as a candidate for president and shared my vision to end the stagnation and return to a rapid growth that's what we did as president I am very proud to say that we accomplished something that nobody thought that was even possible before the pandemic real median household income rose by 7,695 and even after the pandemic annual incomes were up $6,400 the average American household saw $17 ,000 increase in real net worth in 48 months for the bottom 50% of households average wealth more than doubled increasing by 121% lowest income people benefited the most after 12 years of decline we added nearly 7 million new homeowners never happened before and in 3 years we created 7 million new jobs 260% more than projected when I took office when I took office they said you couldn't hit those projections and we were 260% higher than what we said we could do from the day I won to the day I left the SNP 500 increased by 80% and we did it all with virtually no inflation we had virtually no inflation think of that who could believe that I delivered the largest tax cuts and reform in American history by far slashing rates for working families and cutting the business tax from the highest in the world we had the highest in the world 35% and actually when you add local and State numbers that were close getting close to 50 but much much higher nobody's ever seen we brought it all the way down to 21% which everybody said was impossible to do and I heard it from everyone they said you'll never be able to do that and I got it down to 21% I cut a record number of job killing regulations in four years we cut more regulation than any president in the history of our country by far I'm proud to be the only president in modern history to achieve a net regulatory reduction during my term and it was a substantial reduction and for every regulation we added we cut more than 5.5 regulations we unleashed American Energy and within three years we had increased domestic oil production by 47% and we were just getting started the price of gasoline was $187 a gallon doesn't that sound good right now we negotiated and renegotiated more than 50 trade agreements with other countries that were taking advantage of us as they all do to protect the American worker and to open foreign markets and we did a great job I ended NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made in the history of our country and replaced it with the usmca perhaps the best trade deal ever made in history that's Mexico and Canada I stood up to China like no one else before me no one came even close and I saved the US Auto industry from obliteration with a 27.5% tariff on all Chinese cars that remains in place to this day they want to take it off but they can't because number one it's too much money and number two we would be invaded by Chinese cars on top of the other invasions that are taking place without it our Auto industry would be dead and now I am going further we will bring our automaking industry to the record levels of 37 years ago and we'll be able to do it very quickly through tariffs and other smart use of certain things that we have that other countries don't for four straight years I fought for American workers like I would fight for my own family I took care of our economy like I would take care of of my own company in every decision I asked will I create jobs here or will I be sending jobs overseas will it make America richer and stronger or will it make our country weaker and poorer I always put America First every single time and when our country was hit by the China virus we save the economy We rescued tens of millions of jobs and after Co I handed kamala and Joe the fastest and strongest recovery ever recorded nothing even close with 1.4% inflation the 30-year mortgage rate was at 2.4% and the highest stock market in history this is despite the pandemic to dat I handed them back the highest stock market to date after having just suffered with the rest of the world a Pandemic the likes of which nobody had ever seen before we did an incredible job and remember far more people died of covid under Biden Harris than under President Trump many many more people we delivered an economic Miracle which kamala and Joe turned into an economic disaster just like they turned the border and indeed the whole world into a catastrophic surrender starting on day 1 kamla launched a war on American Energy and orchestrated a nation wrecking border Invasion with a legal a aliens pouring in from countries all over the world they came in from countries that nobody ever heard the name of that country those countries from their prisons and jails there is a difference from mental institutions and insane asylums as well as record numbers of terrorists human traffickers and sex traffickers numbers that we've never seen before taking place over the last three and a half years then Cala cast the deciding votes on trillions of dollars in wasteful spending which together with their terrible energy policies gave us the worst inflation perhaps in the history of our country nearly 2third of the jobs created under the Harris Biden administration were bounce back jobs bounce back they were bounce back jobs that I handed them from before the pandemic this happens with pandemics you have bounce back jobs the pandemic comes and it goes and those people go back to their jobs and just last week Joe Biden admitted that on social media I don't know if he knew what he admitted but that's what it said I wonder who drew it perhaps that person is no longer employed by the Democrats but right now it's even worse than that under Kamala Harris's policies 3 million workers are now missing from the job force compared to 2023 million workers that's a lot over half a million fewer people have full-time jobs today than just one year ago and 100% of the net job creation in the past year has gone to Illegal migrants think of that 100% of the jobs created under this Administration has gone to a legal migrants that came into our country Joe Biden and kamala Harris formed the worst presidency and vice presidency by far in the history of our country this election will decide whether we reward kamala Harris with reelection and four more years of crime economic Calamity and international humiliation or whether we change that direction and once again build the greatest economy in the history of the world which we had during the Trump Administration kamala Harris is the first major party nominee in American history who fundamentally rejects freedom and Embraces Marxism communism and fascism you're learning about this you'll find out nobody knew who she was just a few months ago they didn't know who she was she's promising communist price controls wealth confiscation energy Annihilation reparations the largest tax increase ever imposed and mass amnesty and citizenship for tens of millions of migrants who will consume trillions of dollars in federal benefits and Destroy Social Security and Medicare they will be destroyed they're already putting them into your Social Security and Medicare roles I am promising low taxes low regulations low energy costs low interest rates secure borders low low low crime and surging incomes for citizens of every race religion color and Creed my plan will rapidly defeat inflation quickly bring down prices and reignite explosive economic growth kamla Harris will take more money out of American Pockets my plan will leave the typical family with many thousands of dollars more than they have right now first I will end kamala Harris's  anti-energy Crusade and Implement a policy of energy abundance energy Independence and even energy dominance we have more Liquid Gold under our feet than any other country including Russia and Saudi Arabia will be using it my plan will cut Energy prices in half or more than that within 12 months of taking office it will be an economic Revival of our country like no one has ever seen before energy was what caused our problem initially energy is going to bring us back that means we're going down and getting gasoline below $2 a gallon bring down the price of everything from electricity rates to groceries air fairs and housing costs that's why OPEC and the Arab Nations and we're very honored to have some of my friends here with us today from that part of the world but they're working very hard despite being here that I not be your president they don't like me meanwhile kamla Harris can't bring down the price of anything because her energy policies are driving up the cost of everything everything is up way up starting on day one Harris and Biden opened up the Russian pipe line called nordstream 2 which nobody have ever heard of until I got involved and said what about nordstream 2 and nobody knew what I was talking about largest pipeline in the world Russian Pipeline but I had it closed it was shut down Putin was not happy we shut it down they came along and the Keystone Exel pipeline was shut down by them so they shut down the Keystone and they immediately gave Russia the right to start rebuilding the nordstream 2 the biggest pipeline you've ever seen we re-entered the horribly unfair to the United States through them when they came back Paris climate Accord so unfair to us we paid trillions of dollars other countries pay nothing as soon as he came back he went back into it I got a SA of it and reduce the area of the federal lands available for drilling by 80% did that if I was President oil production today would be four times higher than it is right now would have been four times higher right now we'd be doing four times as much and remember we had anoir perhaps the largest drilling site in the world in Alaska which everybody wanted to get approved but they weren't able to do it Ronald Reagan fought so hard to get anoir he couldn't do it and it was easier in those days than it is today with all of the environmental concerns but they came in in their first few days in office they terminated anoir amazingly biggest drilling site we think in the world bigger than Saudi Arabia bigger than Texas we got it and they terminated it under the EPA so-called power plant rule more than 50 power plants have been shut down since she took office and virtually all Coal Fired power plants will be shuttered in the next couple of years setting the stage for a catastrophic energy shortfall which we already have that will make inflation far worse than it has ever been they want to close down our power plants and we don't have power already to address this dire energy crisis that Cala and Joe have created I will immediately issue a National Emergency declaration to achieve massive increase in domestic energy Supply what you're going to need electricity is desperately needed for ai ai cont iial but we got to be the top of it and we would need hard to believe twice the electricity that we currently have right now for everything in order to be dominant and China is already building massive electricity producing plants we haven't even thought about it we will think about it and I'll get it done on an emergency basis so we'll be the leader in Ai and every other form of Technology with these sweeping authorities We Will Blast through every bureaucratic hurdle to issue rapid approvals for new drilling new pipelines new refineries new power plants new electric plants and reactors of all types prices will fall immediately in anticipation of this tremendous Supply that we can create rather quickly and will be the leader instead of the lagard second to further defeat inflation my plan will terminate the green New Deal which I call the green new scam greatest scam in history probably a 10 trillion do scam that we waste we throw like throwing money right out the window it actually sets us back as opposed to moves us forward and weend all unspent funds under the misnamed inflation reduction act which the Democrats agreed after it was approved that it wasn't for that purpose it was for other purposes like giveaways comma spent $7.5 billion to build eight charging stations think of a charging station like a fuel pump with electricity coming out of it eight charging stations in the Midwest for electric vehicles cost billions and billions of dollars 7.5 5 billion they think but the costs are still going and three of them don't work and never will probably other than that it's worked out quite well I will end the electric vehicle mandate stop the appalling waste and save taxpayers an estimated one trillion dollar third I will launch a historic campaign to liberate our economy from crippling regulation my first term I pledged to cut two old regulations for every one new regulation and we did much better than that as I've said yet over the past four years kamala has added $6,300 a year in regulatory costs onto the backs of the typical American family think of that to stop this Onslaught at lower prices I'm pledging today that in my second term we will eliminate a minimum of 10 old regulations for every one new regulation will be able to do that quite easily actually and instead of attacking industries of the future we will embrace them including making America the world capital for crypto and Bitcoin fourth at the suggestion of Elon Musk who has given me his complete and total endorsement that's nice smart guy he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing he very very much appreciated I will create a government efficiency commission task with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms we need to do it can't go on the way we are now and Elon because he's not very busy has agreed to head that task force be interesting if he has the time that' be a good one to do it but he's agreed to do it in 2022 fraud and improper payments alone cause taxpayers an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars as the first order of business this commission will develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months this will save trillions of dollars trillions it's massive for the same service that you have right now trillions of dollars is wasted and gone and nobody knows where it went further taming inflation and bringing prices way down the fifth pillar of my plan is to make the Trump tax cuts permanent they are massive tax cuts biggest ever permanent and to cut taxes even more and we will have no tax on tips something which they copied four weeks after I said it she got up said no tax on tips I said I just said that she is actually copying a lot of my plan in fact we're going to send her a Maga cap sometime in the next week we're having a special one may but we also know she doesn't mean it she's going to stick with what her whole life has been about and also no tax on Social Security benefits people in Social Security have been wiped out by inflation and now on top of it we tax their benefits were not going to tax their benefits we have so many different ways of making so much money this country the potential is is so incredible we don't have to take it away from people on Social Security we're not going to do that we're going to save Social Security she's going to destroy Social Security under the Trump Administration we prove that targeted tax cuts do not increase the deficit they reduce the deficit by growing the economy and raising revenue after we gave the massive tax cuts we took in the following year with a much lower rate billions and billions of dollars more than we did the previous year with a high rate think of that so with a much lower rate we took in more money because people were incentivized corporate tax revenues are 31% higher today than before my tax law was signed with all of those cuts 31% higher to further support the Revival of American manufacturing my plan calls for expanded R&D tax credit credits 100% bonus depreciation expensing for new manufacturing Investments and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% solely for companies that make their product in America you have to make your product in America if you Outsource offshore or replace American workers you're not eligible for any of these benefits in fact you will pay a very substantial tariff when a product comes in from another country that's made in another country and comes in there'll be a big tariff on that product because we want to make our our Goods in America and most of them we can my message is simple make your product here in America and only in America we are not going to be taken advantage of anymore just as we made great inroads and progress four years ago we made tremendous inroads on this subject we're not going to watch our wealth and jobs get ripped away from us and sent to foreign countries which is what's been happening for many many decades with us China was built on doing exactly what we're going to be doing and what I started doing four years ago what we're putting forward is the most pro-american manufacturing and jobs policy in modern history for any country this plan will bring jobs and growth into our country at levels never seen before every business on Earth will flock to America from Europe Asia the Middle East and all over the world by contrast comrade kamala Harris wants to sacrifice our wealth kill the economy and drive jobs overseas to punish businesses more businesses will leave they'll leave America they're International companies they report to their shareholders and they will leave America if her plan even in a small form comes to the four her tax plan which includes the promise to end the Trump tax cuts which Again by itself would be a massive tax increase would increase taxes by over five trillion a record many times over it would result in the largest small business tax hike in history massively raising taxes on 25 million small business people and raising small business tax rates to 43% and higher in other words 20% higher than communist China Kamala is also vowing to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% we're bringing it down to 15% but she really is looking to raise it to 40 45 or even 50% you know that all you have to do is follow her past path radically raise the capital gains tax rate which he wants to do and they don't even want to give a number and for the first time ever impose a 25% tax on unrealized capital gain so if you happen to have a lot of wealth but no cash you're in a lot of trouble this will lead America into a 1929 depression and it will be a depression and a territory that we have not seen for a long time there's a gentleman that happens to believe that Scott these policies especially the tax on unrealized capital gains would decimate the US economy companies and Innovation would flee from America to other countries Venture Capital markets would disappear the stock market would be annihilated and investors assess the tax liabilities of large shareholders the seniors and Senior pensions would totally go up in smoke that'd be worthless these are not the policies designed to create a prosperous America these are policies to turn the United States into Venezuela on steroids even if for this reason alone kamala Harris must be defeated decisively this November has to be defeated cannot have her be the president of the United States under commy the United States is becoming a third world Banana Republic she and her party are censoring speech weaponizing the justice system and trying to throw their political opponents me in jail this hasn't happened I didn't do that to Crooked Hillary I said that would be a terrible thing wouldn't it putting the wife of the president of the United States in jail but they view it differently I guess nowadays but that's okay and they always have to remember that two can play the game nobody ever thought this was possible this is how you create massive Capital flight and turn once prosperous Nations into absolute ruins I will have no higher priority as president then to restore the fair equal and impartial rule of law in America we have lost the rule of law who would have [Applause] thought number six under my leadership America will encourage domestic production instead of punishing it as you know our country's vast manufacturing wealth was created at a time with very little domestic taxation few regulations and most Revenue came from tariffs from other countries that was when we were at the wealthiest ever proportionately we were the wealthiest country ever during those days that was before income tax came along now we foolishly do the opposite we impose lower tariffs and no tariffs on foreign producers we have the lowest tariffs of any nation in the world and we relentlessly punish our own companies for doing business in America you do business in America you're punished tremendously I had many many companies come to me sir I can't compete the sending kitchen cabinets washers and dryers everything that I can tell you every motorcycle they're sending them here sir we can't compete and I made it so they could compete and Thrive every one of those people we should get them up and talk to you one day because every one of those people comes up to me and every time I see them they hug me they kiss me they love me because I save their businesses I intend to reverse this model and once again turn America into the manufacturing superpower of the world we can do that just just with being intelligent the key to this effort will be a pro-american trade policy that uses tariffs to encourage production here and bring trillions and trillions of dollars back home and you know what we deserve it we've been helping other countries get rich at our expense for the last 50 years we've been pouring our money into other countries getting nothing nothing for it we protect them militarily we do so much for them we get nothing my plan is that if you open your factory in Wisconsin Pennsylvania Michigan Minnesota anywhere else in our country you don't pay a tariff tax you don't pay a tax you can make the product here but if you move your production outside of the United States and send it back here which people are doing now and I stopped it I stopped at cold but they've changed that already then you'll have to pay a very substantial tax to get your product back into the country the result will be that everybody in the world will want to be here and they want to produce here they're going to want to produce their product in America it's going to say made in the USA we will be able to build ships again we will be able to build planes again we will be able to build our military again from within all from within we will create the biggest greatest and strongest middle class in the history of our country we will have have tens of millions of high-paying jobs in manufacturing Transportation defense as well as all of the sales and support of export jobs our Auto industry will be the biggest beneficiary in short it will be a National Economic Renaissance just by using our heads by being smart by not letting other countries take advantage of us they've been doing it for so long it's so sad to see and I know them all and they left at us behind our back they can't believe how stupid our leadership has been for so many years we will ensure that the United States has a giant steel industry an aluminum industry a manufacturing base and a defense base we want a industrial base that can take care of our defense needs 100% And you can call it what you want some might say it's economic nationalism I call it common sense I call it America First this is the policy that built this country and this is the policy that will save our country in the words of a great but highly underrated President William McKinley highly underrated the protective tariff policy of the Republicans has been made and made the lives of our countrymen sweeter and brighter writer it's the best for our citizenship and our civilization and it opens up a higher and better Destiny for our people we have to take care of our own nation and her Industries first in other words take care of our country first this is when we had our greatest wealth he was assassinated and he left his group of people that followed him Teddy Roosevelt became a great president spending the money that was made by McKinley so McKinley got a bad deal on that one he built tremendous wealth they had the Tariff Act of 1887 and they had a committee that studied what are we going to do they had a big problem a problem like I hope to have with this country someday so much money was coming in from foreign countries that they didn't know how to spend it they had no idea so they set up a committee we'll set one up with the people in this room how do we distribute the wealth that we have and Roosevelt built dams and built railroads and did National Parks but he did it with the money that was made with tariffs from McKinley so you have to remember that very highly underrated very underrated president let's give them both credit smart tariffs will not create inflation they will combat inflation I had almost no inflation and I had the highest tariffs that anyone's seen and they were going a lot higher foreign Nations will pay us hundreds of billions of dollars reducing the deficit and driving inflation down it'll largely reduce our deficit in my first term we imposed historic tariffs with no effect on consumer prices or inflation the anti-ar people many of them I believe honestly work for these other countries in some form get tremendous amounts of lobbying money and other money because it doesn't make sense what they're saying but we had no inflation and we had protection and I saved so many Industries I saved the steel industry but Biden and Harris are letting it go they're letting it go it's so easy to keep a combination of fair trade tax cuts regulatory cuts and energy abundance will allow us to produce more Goods better and cheaper right here in the USA than we've ever done before and foreign Nations will respect us again I got along great with foreign Nations and I taxed the hell out of them and they liked me maybe they respected me and Victor Orban a very strong man man he's the prime minister of Hungary he said the only thing missing from the world right now is President Trump he kept the world safe because everybody was afraid of him I don't like that term but that's the term he used I would like to say respected him and respected our country but he didn't say that he said everybody was afraid of him he said China was afraid Russia was afraid they were all afraid Kim Jong-un I got along great with him and I try to explain to the fake news media that getting along with people foreign countries is a good thing not a bad thing it's a very good thing it's a smart thing we will require all essential materials for our national security to be produced here in the United States creating millions and millions of new manufacturing jobs you know when we built the F-35 we have the wings built in one country we have the tail Rudders built in another country we have the seats built in another country we have the electronics built in seven different countries what the hell would we do if there's a war and we'll end up fighting half of those countries and we don't want to have a war because right now we're closer to World War II that we've ever been in our lives with Russia Ukraine which would have never happened if I was president with October 7th and Israel the whole Middle East is is blowing up would have never happened they would have never happened respectfully Iran was broke they had no money for Hamas they had no money for Hezbollah wouldn't have happened there would be peace in the Middle East and Iran would be a big beneficiary of that peace be good but all of these things that happened and inflation would have never happened and Afghanistan would have never happened the worst with draw in history I believe the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country in fact that's what caused President Putin to go into Ukraine when he looked at how incompetently that was handled he looked at it and he said man they're incompetent that was the most embarrassing day in the history of the United States of America airplanes taking off with many people still on the wings of the plane and the side of the plane and the wing and you see them dropping off the ples at 3,000 ft they thought it was their trip to Freedom there's never been anything like that and I think there's no greater embarrassment by the way we lost 13 incredible soldiers I got to know the families very well spent a lot of time with them four days ago in Arlington Cemetery three years ago they were celebrating three years honoring their children and yeah that's right they call them their children they still call they always will call them their children they're gone and many of those people there should have never left from there they should have left from barram the Big Air Base but many of those people that were so badly hurt they don't talk about them no legs no arms obliteration of their face their entire body and nobody mentions that we left Americans behind large numbers we left $85 billion worth of equipment behind because we took our military out first a child would know you don't you take your military out last and just remember one final point on that because it's a little bit different from our subject but not really because it's all about our country and Common Sense but for 18 months I spoke to the leader of the Taliban the Press was very upset that I spoke to him his name is Abdul I said Abdul don't do this Abdul don't do this but why but why he said do you send me a picture of my home I said Abdul you're going to have to figure that one out for yourself but don't do this Abdul because it's going to end badly for you and for 18 months we didn't have one soldier shot at or killed in Afghanistan and then we took our soldiers out we had a very very disgraceful a disgraceful election and this group came in and they didn't know what the hell they were doing and they still don't they've gotten worse you know with experiences supposed to get better they got worse they're worse now than they ever were and uh we're going to turn our country around we're going to become a major producer of rare earth minerals we're going to create jobs and making it really and US truly self-reliant Remember The Rare Earth where we have to go to China we have sites that are tied up with more than anybody else has they're environmentally protected we have sites that are phenomenal everything you want in terms of rare earth and we can't use them because of Environmental Protection but we're going to end that very quickly as soon as I get to office we will make housing much more affordable as inflation is tamed interest rates will dramatically fall they'll be down very very low we'll get them down we had them down to 2.4% and even lower than that for a period of time reducing mortgage rates is a big factor we're going to get them back down down to we think 3% maybe even lower than that saving the average home buyer thousands of dollars per year they can now go outyoung people will be able to buy a home again and be a part of the American dream we will eliminate regulations that drive up housing cost with the goal of cutting the cost of a new home in half we think we can do that the regulations alone cost 30% regulation cost 30% of a new home and we will open up portions of federal land for large scale housing construction these zones will be ultra low tax and ultra low regulation one of the great really small business job creation programs it will be of all time we're going to open up our country to building homes inexpensively so young people and other people can buy homes can't buy them anymore millions of Americans will take part in setting these safe and beautiful communities Reviving The Frontier spirit and really as I said Reviving The American Dream It's about the American dream it's all about the American dream we don't talk about American dream with these people in office they don't want to talk about the American dream because the they're the exact opposite they're the exact opposite we also cannot ignore the impact that the flood of 21 million illegal aliens has had on driving up housing costs that's why my plan will ban mortgages for illegal aliens in California they're passing a law where they're going to give Cal we going to give illegal aliens money to buy a house but our soldiers our veterans that are laying on the streets they can't have them you have soldiers right now laying on the streets of different cities all Democrat run they're laying on the streets in of hotels in some cases luxury hotels and you have illegal immigrants coming in and living in those hotels and laughing at our soldiers as they walk by into a luxury Lobby is there something wrong with that thinking is there something wrong with our country if Kamala is allowed to continue to let our country be invaded we will face a fiscal Armageddon these migrants are consuming hundreds of B millions of dollars in benefits you saw in Colorado this week a group from Venezuela rough ones rough ones they took over large sections of a town large sections of an area of Colorado Aurora has anyone been there I think it'd better stay away for a little while they had AK-47s the ultimate guns AK-47s they can blow lots of people away real fast and the sheriff didn't want to touch him nobody wants to touch him Sheriff there's 18 Venezuelans attacking my building would you please come over and straighten out the situation he's got a deputy you know what they say uh well no thanks let's call in the military they had taken over and I said this four years ago when they when I realize they wanted open borders and it's happened it's happening now in Chicago they're taking over sections of Chicago what's happening in New York in Los Angeles and many other cities is not even describable they're tough they're tough and they're smart and they're vicious don't forget they come from the prisons and they're the bad criminals on the streets Caracus Venezuela has almost no crime next year I'm going to suggest that the economic Club hold its meeting in Caracus because we'll be safer than we are in our country if they win we'll be far safer but crime and Venezuela is down 72% because they've taken all of their criminals off the streets not all of them they still have some left but they're coming in rapidly by bus and by plane they coming into our country and we're dumping them in our country and they say if you come back we will kill you and they're not going back we got them but they're going back if I'm president I guarantee you that they're going back fast and now Cala wants to give them food stamps housing assistance welfare Medicaid Medicare Social Security and destroy all of those programs you will destroy those programs that is why I will ask Congress to pass legislation barring all taxpayer funded benefits to illegal aliens and by the way when you do that they won't come they're coming now because they realize they've never seen wealth like this they're getting things that they could never get they're coming for that reason if you stop that you'll have you'll be dropping the Flow by 80% I think even more than that they're coming because they're taken care of they're let's put them in a luxury let's put them in the Waldorf Historia that's a nice place I will stop The Invasion and send criminal illegal aliens back home and when we do all of this we will be so successful we'll create America's own Sovereign wealth fund to invest in great National Endeavors for the benefit of all of the American people why don't we have a wealth fund other countries have wealth funds we have nothing we have nothing we're going to have a sovereign wealth fund or we can name it something different I'll talk about it with Mr Paulson who's in the audience and a lot of other friends of mine and we'll name it something that's appropriate perhaps Sovereign wealth fund wouldn't be appropriate but it's going to be the same thing we'll put tremendous amounts of money through all this money that will take be taken in through tariffs and other intelligent things and we'll have the greatest Sovereign wealth fund of them all and we should have and that will be used to do things that will be great great for our country including to invest and wisely invest and build it up bigger and stronger and better than any place on Earth we will build extraordinary National development projects and everything from highways to airports and to Transportation infrastructure all of the future we'll be able to invest in state of the art manufacturing hubs Advanced defense capabilities Cutting Edge medical research and help save billions of dollars in preventing disease in the first place and I'm very honored to have been endorsed last week by Robert F Kennedy Jr that was a great endorsement and he's very much into helping people he's very much into helping people I've known him a long time that was a great uh that was a great thing when he did that that was not easy for a Kenedy to be endorsing a republican that was not easy but these are not Democrats these are radical left lunatics and you can't let them run your country we will invest in new and modern agricultural techniques so we can have safe healthy high quality foods for our families that's where Bobby is so interested Foods he says we're putting a lot of bad foods in our body you look at other countries which do far less and they're actually much healthier than we are this wealth fund will return a gigantic profit which will help pay down national debt we're going to work on national debt very strongly by the way we're going to have so much money coming in we're going to work on national debt we're close to $36 trillion right now we're going to work on getting it down and it is many of the people in this room who will be helping to advise and recommend Investments for this fund this is how we will end the era of inflation Mayhem and misery under Cala Harris the worst vice president in the history of our country and unleash a new era of safety prosperity and success for our workers our families and our businesses and I've done it before we did a great job and now we really know our job well I know the smartest the best people we have the best people we have people that many in this room they know exactly what we want to do you know it's interesting having experience because I won an election I went to Washington I was only in Washington 17 times I never stayed over that's according to the fake news but I think they're right but I got to know Washington well and I know the Smart Ones and the dumb ones I know the ones that can help make us great and the ones that can only take us into bad territory I got to know a lot of people probably as many as anybody at that level and we have incredible talent that we're going to be using that Talent we had some incredible Talent much of it sitting up here and sitting down here they did a great job on trade Bob lighthiser so many other people did such a great job we rebuilt our military we rebuilt our entire military did a great job we have great generals not the television generals not the generals that took us out of Afghanistan in 24 hours and left that horrible situation but we have great generals we defeated Isis it was supposed to take five years it took me four weeks four weeks my generals did a great job we have great people in our military and our military is not woke believe me you couldn't get these guys to be woke some of the guys on top are woke but those aren't the ones that are great so we're going to do things things that we didn't do even the first time we had a great presidency we were there was an article written the other day that the Trump presidency was a great presidency With Victory on November 5th which will go down as the most important day in the history of our country inflation will be gone our energy will be Unleashed our economy will be set free our sovereignty will be restored our citizens will Thrive growth will come roaring back and America's future will be brighter than ever before so I want to thank you all this has been a lovely experience it was years ago that I was here we talked about what we were going to do and we did just about everything we said and uh if you'd like we'll take a few questions Bob great thank you very much thank you it's a great question the problem with what we have with sanctions and I was a user of sanctions but i' put them on and take them off as quickly as possible because ultimately it kills your dollar and it kills everything the dollar represents and we have to continue to have that be the world currency I think it's important I think would be losing a war if we lost if we lost the dollar as a as the world currency I think that would be the equivalent of losing a war that would make us a third world country and we can't let it happen so I use sanctions very powerfully against countries that deserve it and then I take them off because look you're losing Iran you're losing Russia China is out there trying to get their currency to be the dominant currency as you know better than anybody all of these things are happening you're losing so many countries because there's so much conflict with all of these countries that you're going to lose that and we can't lose that so uh I want to use sanctions as little as possible one of the things that we have with tariffs is that I'll say to him you don't honor the dollar as your world currency is that right you're not going to do it no we're not I said that's okay I'm going to put tariffs all over your product and they're going to say Sir we'd love to honor the dollar as the world currency you know tariffs in addition to monetary and the money that we'll take in which will be bigger than you've ever seen in this country before gives you tremendous political power for something like that as an example I stopped Wars with the threat of tariffs I stopped Wars with two countries that uh mattered a lot a lot of people would have been killed and I threatened tariffs coming into the United States if they don't make peace and we made a lot of we didn't have conflicts like you have right now we had very intelligent people but the biggest threat you have is you lose that currency and we have lost something that you'll never get back and we can keep it if we're smart but they use it too much and then they just forget about it and these countries like Russia it's going out now and doing its own thing and you know they're going out bragging about how they don't need us anymore etc etc uh the sad part about Russia is that Ukraine would have never happened if I was President so we wouldn't really have to be talking about sanctions but uh it did happen and one of the things I'm going to do a little bit relevant to your question is if we win I believe I can settle that war while I'm president-elect before I ever get into office I can get that War settled and get that war stopped cuz it's a horrible horrible war and far more people are killed in Ukraine far more people than you're realizing they'll knock down this massive building amazing the size of these buildings they'll knock it down they'll say nobody was injured no a lot of people were killed the real numbers are far greater than what people are are looking at so I think it's a very important thing thing uh sanctions have to be used very judiciously and you can win we have things much more powerful actually than sanctions we have trade but we cannot lose our dollar standard very important thank you very much so I had a great relationship with presiden she of China really very close relationship uh now look he likes China I like us so but I don't want to sound foolish he was my dear dear friend he's a tough guy he's a fierce person I say very smart you know when you say he's smart the fake news goes crazy he said president she is smart and I say you well he controls 1 point four billion people with an iron fist he's smart but we had a very good relationship with China until Co and when that came in it was a whole different ball game as far as I was concerned you know we made a Great China trade deal maybe better than the usmca and I'd never talk about it because what happened with covid for the whole world $60 trillion dollar and you know deaths 70 million 60 nobody even knows how many deaths and it all came out of Wuhan so it changed my relationship but I think I'll have a great relationship with China I had one before and they respected us but they respected us because they no longer thought we were fools they used to think we were fools because we built China they would take over $500 billion a year and use it for their military and other things and we got nothing out of that we got some cheap product we got that you can buy 19 pencils instead of two who the hell cares you can buy $16 dolls for your daughter instead of two nice dolls and we got very little out of that relationship they got a tremendous military power and they still have it today so uh but I believe we will have a very good relationship with China and with a lot of other countries that we're not getting along with too well today and uh things are going to straighten out we're going to get Dem straighten out very quickly very important that we get along with the rest of the world you know we have things today called nuclear weapons I rebuilt our whole military including our nuclear capability and so I got very familiar with it and uh you know I say this often because I had an uncle who was the longest serving I believe the longest serving I was told that by MIT but he was there 39 I guess or 41 years longest serving professor the history of MIT and nuclear was something he knew a lot about and we used to talk about it I'd say uncle John there's no way he was telling me about this incredible power that was being Unleashed potentially and I say uncle John you could never and you know what he was very modest because I've seen the destructive capability and this world is going to have to get along because if that's ever Unleashed we already have too many countries that have at least remnants of it with some of it but probably five countries if you think and Kim Jong-un when when I was went to the White House after winning in 2016 I sat with President Obama which is a ritual and you sit and you talk and I said what's the biggest problem he said North Korea is the biggest problem I don't think it's solvable I said have you tried calling him or talking to him and actually the answer was yes and he wasn't responding to but I did and we were very very safe it started off a little rocky if you remember Little Rocket Man I called him and he called me things too he's got a red button on his desk I said I have a bigger red button and my red button works I said and then it started getting a little nicer and then one day I got a call that they'd like to meet and it was a great thing we had a great meeting we had two meetings actually two great meetings Summits and we had no problem with them now they have a problem because they're not liking this Administration they don't respect this administration at all so we have to get along we have to get along we can't have World War II you're going to end up in World War II just like you you should have never had Russia go in it would have never happened if a competent person L us it would have never happened he led them into it and I'm not blaming Biden but you know what what he was saying was exactly the wrong thing I said we're going to have an invasion because of a lot of the rhetoric it was stupid rhetoric but it would have never happened not only for that reason oil was down low you know oil was almost at $100 a barrel so Putin is one of the only people I mean it's nothing's easy in life but Putin at $100 a barrel War works at $40 a barrel it didn't work at all so we're going to get back to a intelligently Run Place a place where other countries are using the word nuclear that word was never talked about during my because I knew the power of it and I talked to Putin about it I talked to president XI about it I think we were going to do you remember the talk where we were going to uh reduce nuclear capability substantially all three of us we're going to start it we're going to reduce very substantially and then we had the election and after the election they didn't talk about that or anything else frankly but uh we have to be very very careful because the destructive capability of nuclear when people talk about global warming I say the ocean is going to go down 100th of an inch within the next 400 years that's not our problem our problem is nuclear warming and we better be smart and we better have smart people at the top that know how to deal because these people don't know how to deal Putin came out today he endorsed Kamala and I didn't know was I supposed to call him up and say thank you very much I appreciate it but he endorsed Kamala I have a feeling I don't know I don't I don't know exactly what to say about that I don't know if I'm insulted or he did me a favor but we have to get along with the world we can't have War because the destructive capability you can be the head of the biggest bank wherever the hell Jamie is sitting you can be the head of the biggest bank in the world and a couple of nukes and your bank doesn't mean a thing you got to get along this is such an important job it's a dangerous job too very dangerous job if you look it statistically being president is very dangerous that that throbbing feeling I have oh that throbbing feeling no it's a very dangerous job and uh you have to do it right and if you don't do it right bad things will happen to the world things like you've never seen before okay thank you very much thank you um thank well we just hit record highs at numbers that nobody ever thought possible you're right it's over $2 trillion do nobody thought that was a number that was I mean you could go back four years nobody thought a number like that would be possible it's crazy it's like it's just horrible actually but uh yeah we're two trillion and I view it as profit and loss to a certain extent a lot of people say it's trade you know you have many people say trade deficits don't matter I think they matter a lot I think they matter a lot uh we're going to have tremendous growth this what I'm talking about is all about growth the tax is relatively minor compared to the growth we're going to make our money back on growth we're going to also I mean we're going to grow like nobody's ever grown before I think if this all works out you're going to have the Auto industry come back to America right now China is building two Auto factories in Mexico Mass massive Auto factories and they think they're going to make their cars in Mexico and send them back into the United States with no tax it's not going to happen under this Administration is going to happen and they wanted to do that during my Administration I said if you do it we're going to put a 200% tariff on every car and you'll never be able to see it there will never be one car coming across our border and if I would have let them do it we would have had these two factories well now they're building massive factories more than two and they're going to kill Detroit and the head of the Union the United Auto Workers in Detroit has done a terrible terrible job just a terrible job but we're going to bring tremendous growth back and remember we're also taking in a certain percentage I won't name the percentage today but it'll be a certain tariff percentage which will be higher than people had heard in the past and we will be bringing in billions and billions of dollars which will directly reduce our well I would do that and we're sitting down you know I was uh somebody we had Senator Marco Rubio and my daughter Ivanka was so uh impactful on that issue it's a very important issue but I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I'm talking about that because is look Child Care is child care it's couldn't you know there's something you have to have it in this country you have to have it but when you talk about those numbers compared to the kind of numbers that I'm talking about by taxing foreign Nations at levels that they're not used to but they'll get used to it very quickly and it's not going to stop them from doing business with us but they'll have a very substantial tax when they send product into our country uh those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that we're talking about including child care that it's going to take care we're going to have I I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time coupled with uh the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country because I have to stay with Jare I want to stay with Jare but those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I'm talking about including growth but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just uh that I just told you about we're going to be taking in millions of dollars and as much as child care uh is talked about as being expensive it's relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we'll be taken and we're going to make this into an incredible country that can afford to take care of its people and then we'll worry about the rest of the world let's help other people but we're going to take care of our country first this is about America first it's about make America great again we have to do it because right now we're a failing Nation will'll take care of it thank you very good question thank you",2024/9/5,Econoimc_Club_NY,Youtube

we fell in love like almost immediately yes and her sister was just unbelievable to and uh she passed away like a couple of years ago now it's a long time ago it seems it goes fast right but what a great combination we love you both they were loyal to me from day one when they heard stuff they said that's a lot of crap one they were with me from day one day one and that Trump sign gets bigger and bigger I said that's so nice I want to buy one for myself don't too worry Mr President I'm going to give you one I don't worry you know what you know what we appreciate your loyalty your friendship and I saw silk backstage I said I'm bringing you upstage I'm going to bring you up stage and we miss your great sister and we love you and thank you very so much more thank you  great all right Mr President are you ready yeah I'm going to be very careful with these seats yeah it's a little bit these seats weren't designed for me [Laughter] exactly all right Mr President our first question comes from Ally she was one of the residence here in North Carolina that was directly impacted by the hurricane and it destroyed her community Ally where you at good evening president Trump my name is Ally and I'm from the foothills of North Carolina our entire Community has been decimated thank you president Trump for visiting the disaster sites to bring attention and donating millions in relief thank you ell this week this week we have learned that not only did 13,000 13,000 murderers illegally cross our border but FEMA is out of money because they have been providing $9,000 to every illegal enough enough is enough we must put Americans first how soon will you start deporting the murderers so let let me just tell you that you're right about that it's uh 13,099 to be exact and murderers many of these people murdered more than one person some one did seven these are not people we want in our country so there was I guess released by somebody that loves us uh maybe in Border Patrol we don't know exactly where the numbers but these are certified numbers and you had 16,000 uh drug traffickers you had uh numbers that nobody's ever seen 645,000 criminals overall they in our country they nobody has any idea they're from places unknown nobody knows who they are what they are but we know that we have over 600,000 people released into our country along with the ones that you were talking about the 21,000 but of them 13,000 more than 13,000 are murderers and uh some were on schedule to die they were scheduled for the death penalty and we have them now nicely ins sconed in our country I'll tell you what we have the worst president and the worst vice president in the history of America is they are horrible they are horrible that that could happen and just the concept of open borders doesn't make sense you know we built 500 miles of wall more and we're going to add another 200 much more than I said I was going to do and that's why we had we had the best numbers ever oh the chart so you know the chart my favorite chart Ally my favorite piece of paper my favorite chart but we had a chart do you have something up here that could show I love that I love that chart oh I love that chart if I didn't look to the right I wouldn't be going to Butler tomorrow you know we're going to Butler tomorrow but I didn't look over so uh no but that if you look at the chart at the arrow on the bottom that shows the lowest number in the history of our country that was the day day I left office and these clowns took over and what they've done to our country between that and so many other things what they've done to our country but you know I view inflation was the worst we've ever had I think they say oh it was only in 48 years somebody one of the fake news back there they corrected me one time they said no 48 years oh okay but it wasn't I believe it was the worst that we've ever had and that's been one of the big problems but to me and I know that you talk about the bad economy you talk about all of the costs and the costs are so bad to me the worst is the Border because it's like what they're doing is they're destroying our country and it's not easy we're going to get them out we're going to have the largest deportation in history I'm not proud to say that either but it's it's a tough thing to do and we're going to get Anna we're going to get the criminals out we're going to start with the worst of them we're going to get them out and you know who's going to help us local law enforcement local law enforcement they're going to be great they know their names they know their serial numbers we're going to get them out and you know very simply we have a little thing called Mega everybody who knows Mega is called make America great again that's what we're going to do we're going to make America great again thank you darling really good question thank you you know Mr President to your credit too I think that's largely why you've actually outpaced every other candidate for president with the support from the Hispanic American Community because it's not just a raceing we all want border security so thank you Mr President it's an incredible community that we I don't know it's just very energetic you know that right it's energetic and they're very entrepreneurial and they just they love our country and we have we've gotten record numbers with the Hispanic community and uh I don't know it just works it just works so I appreciate it very much thank you thank you darl very much thank you guys all right Mr President our next question is from John he was a a Greenbay Captain who was actually kicked out of the military I think he's going to share his story with you one second hi goodlook guy thank you good evening Mr President I'm John frankman I was a special force as green beray who was forced out of the military because of the covid-19 VAC stuff right that's good that's good so the Biden Harris DOD covid-19 vaccine mandate was very damaging to the military it forced thousands and of service members out and thousands do not want to join now the Biden Harris DOD has the lowest recruiting in modern history and now they're pushing more woke training so how do you plan to repair the military uh from the damage that was done and hold military leaders accountable so I want to have them come back into the military with pay and you know they've been talking about that but it never happened they never did what they said they were going to do they should have never been a mandate that should have never happened you should have been given choices we say we want choice in education and we we want a choice there too and that should have never happened and you know we've lost some of our best people in the military too did you leave leave did you leave did you ever take the vaccine or anything I never did Sir so you won a choice yeah and do you want would you go back in if they were able to as long as there's accountability potentially yeah no there would be accountability is right they can I will'll fire their asses but they w we don't want to lose this guy we want to get he's he's Central Casting we want to get him back in uh yeah we're going to take care of it I hope you do come back or I hope you do very well outside be honest wherever you are I just want you to do well uh but we're going to get a lot of people coming back they should have never had the Mandate the Mandate was a big mistake and they treated people terribly terribly okay thank you very much great you look great thank you we lost a lot of great people also in other you know when police forces I mean a lot of a lot of people were forced into doing things they didn't want to do but I love that question that's a great question thank you very much I also um if I could Mr President I don't think I've told you this story yet but actually we had some of our friends that had been deployed and one of our friends actually was sto uh shot pretty badly and ended up going to Walter Reed and to put in perspective there's a lot of politicians that will take photos with the military but they don't care but president Trump actually went privately didn't ask for a photo opportunity and he said thank you to our friend that had been shot in combat at Walter Reed his heart's in it he loves our community when I say that he has your back you he's going to make sure that they're accountable he will thank you thank you very much and I'll tell you the you know we have a a great military we really do but Walter Reed you mentioned the name and that hospital was unbelievable the doctors are unbelievable they had a lot of problems with getting there getting to it you know managerially getting into see but we had the best doctors they could do things that nobody else could do and they got to see some really badly hurt people and uh the level of talent at Walter Reed it's just an incredible hospital so we have to pay our due respects you know you hear so much about government owned or whatever I don't think there's a better Hospital in the world than Walter Ridge so we should say that right yes sir yes sir Mr President our next question comes from an active duty service member here at Fort Brag they like it Austin where you at oh front row that was good good evening Donald Trump thank you president never mind I've never done this before uh I'm an active duty Soldier here at Fort Liberty and I'd want to start off by saying I'm here in personal capaity he metant Fort Brag right yes for bre now are you not you're not a soldier now no I am a soldier I'm currently Dy good um but on a oh that gives out I'm here in my personal capacity not speaking on behalf of the army or DOD in any way right uh this week we saw the missiles flying into Israel from Iran and how impressive the IR Iron Dome is in protecting Israel what are we thought what are our thought or what are your thoughts on the Iron Dome for America I love it I mean I love it how can you I love it we're going to have it one of the things I say we're going to have an Iron Dome why shouldn't we have an Iron Dome and you see how effective so the other day 287 big missiles ballistic missiles were shot into Israel every single one of them was taken down well why shouldn't we have that and it's all going to be made in the United States you know was our technology it's all going to be made in the US and a lot of it's going to be made in a place called North Carolina if you don't mind okay and I think I I think I just learned the secret to look we're going to win I believe you got to get out there you got to vote and all that but I think I just learned the secret to winning absolutely and by Massive margins I'm going to promise to you as I said at the beginning that we're going to change the name back to Fort Brag because I think when that word gets out I just see this great looking Soldier just accidentally said Fort Liberty and he got almost booed the hell out of the place that was very that was not good anyway uh I believe it's absolutely something that we want to have for safety and we're a target for a lot of different places I I listened to Biden yesterday you know since I went under the wing you know I used to go under the wing of the aircraft nobody ever did that before I did all of a sudden Bon started but he only takes like a half a question usually can't answer it but they asked him what do you think about uh what do you think about Iran would you hit Iran and he goes as long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff that's the thing you want to hit right I said I think he's got that one wrong isn't that the what you're supposed to hit I mean it's the most it's the biggest risk we have nuclear weapons the power of nuclear weapons the power of Weaponry you know I rebuilt the entire military jets everything I built it including nuclear and I hated to build the nuclear but I got to know firsthand the power of that stuff and I'll tell you what uh we we have to be totally prepared we have to be absolutely prepared but when they asked them that question the answer should have been hit the nuclear first and worry about the arrest later and uh that's what they should that's what they if they're going to do it if they're going to do it they're going to do it but we'll find out whatever their plans are but great question thank you very much thank you thank you Austin Mr President I don't think you get enough credit for what you did with the Abraham Accords I mean that really was historical I agree I agree but realistically because of the failed foreign policy out of this current Administration we are on the verge of World War II when you get back in office what are you going to do to change it so a lot of things are happening very fast and you know we could end up in World War II before we get there the way it's going right now look at Russia with Ukraine that's a disaster look at the Middle East that's exploding all over the place and we have people that look we have a president this spend Mo he spends most of his time on the beach sleeping I never saw a guy could sleep in front of a camera does anybody think of it I I don't sleep that much I toss and turn I think I think I think I'm always thinking you ever do that you're sweating and you're thinking and you're trying to figure out how to beat this one that look how to make our country great but I toss and I turn this guy just falls asleep in the beach like there's nothing to it I wish I had that ability that's one ability he has that I do not have and I wouldn't mind having it I could use a little extra sleep but we are going to we are going to do things with our country you just have to be respect it again you know Victor Orban he's uh you know the fake news a lot of fake news back there by the way but the fake news the fake news you know they call him a strong man he's the head of uh Hungary and we have and he's you know very strong guy very tough guy but I mean more than anything else a very smart guy and they said why is the world blowing up you have the Middle East is blowing up you have Russia Ukraine that could lead to catastrophy you talk about nuclear weapons that could be a total catastrophe why is it he said if you put Trump back in the white house it's all going to end you're going to have peace you know we had four years we didn't have any wars we didn't have any terrorism we didn't have anything and I won't tell you exactly what he said maybe I will he said because they were afraid of trump I don't want to be the one saying that but they were probably afraid of me because they couldn't they think I was crazy and that's a good thing to think right Soldier that's a good they said they said this guy is crazy but no he said that you put Trump back in the White House you're not going to have all of that stuff is going to heal October 7th would have never happened the attack on Israel would have never happened remember Iran was broke they weren't giving money to Hezbollah they weren't giving money to anybody any of these uh they call them delegates of Terror a lot of different names but it's always of Terror and there was no money for Hamas and now you look we had no we had you know because you were such a big part of it we had no attacks we had no terrorism we had no nothing for four years we had and I wanted to talk about it during the four years but that's never smart right Robert that's never smart to do so I didn't but I talk about it a lot now we had no attacks we had none of this stuff going on uh we defeated Isis by the way we took Isis we defeated them in four weeks it was supposed to take 5 years I rebuilt the military and we had a military like and we have great generals not the television guys by the way the real generals I'm talking about like raisin cane General raan cane you know who that is but we defeated Isis quickly it was supposed to take 5 years we did it in four way we have a great military and we have a military that's not woke you may have a few people on the top that are woke and we're going to get rid of them so damn fast your head's going to yeah he's not kidding I mean we've traveled around the world just on codels and every single world leader that we met with said that they needed you back cuz you'd be tough on China they know the other people won't be tough on China but you'll be tough on China well even China likes us back you know China wants to see a little stability too but I charged China hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs and they paid it and frankly we had a good relationship with president shei but uh they paid hundreds of billions of dollars no other president got them to pay 10 cents not literally not 10 cents got hundreds of billions of dollars and you know what more importantly they respected your country they don't respect us anymore they respected your country and they'll respect us again amen sir peace through strength our next question is from Sarah Sarah is a VA Advocate Sarah where you at oh perfect hi SAR again we're working now um as you know you talked about Walter Reed sir and I'll just say my husband is one of the most catastrophically wounded surviving service members and you visited with him there many times wow and this past July you saw him in Charlotte yes sir is he here no not tonight but you just saw him this summer so he was so happy Su yes sir yes sir but I want to talk about all the advancements you made for Community Care and you empowered veterans to choose their own providers and secretary W and I was so proud to stand with you many times in the white house as you signed historic legislation and executive orders to take care of our military and Veteran families we've watched that Community Care access where a veteran can choose his or her own provider we've watched that be actively limited and actively rolled back president Trump how are you going to bring that back as a day one priority and give veterans the choice for the best medical care back again it's such a great question and and thank you and what a good wife that is and I'll bet your husband's great you love your husband right do you know the people like you what is your first name Sarah Sarah people like Sarah are so important to our country because they take care of people that are great Heroes real heroes and they take care and if they didn't take care or the hospitals would be unable to do it they just would be there this right now I mean with all of the migrants the migrants have taken over our hospitals they've taken over our school we don't have anything but people like Sarah the job they do is incredible and they do it out of pure love they don't do it for any other reason they do it out of pure love and we have to help them we have to help them because the medical core would be unaffordable by our nation it would be totally unaffordable and it was better before and I heard it sliding I spoke with Robert before and he who did by the way an incredible job you did an incredible J stand up please stand up and Sarah we had thank you Robert you know we had a 92% approval rating at the VA 92% now it's down into the 40s we had a thing called choice where if you had to wait too long for a doctor you know the story if you had to wait too long guys were waiting four five six months they go in with a minor problem they end up being terminally ill because they didn't take care of it it could have been taken care of with a shot with a pill with a minor operation they end up dying and we changed it and we had choice we also had accountability remember accountability so on choice they tried to get it for 52 years accountability for 58 years accountability you couldn't fire anybody in the VA and I said that's no good because you had sadists in the VA you had bad people in the we had some bad people and we fired about 9,000 people and we replaced them with 9,000 good loving people that love our heroes right that love our patriotic Heroes and that was a big thing and I just said to Robert how's it going nowadays how is it going and he said they're getting rid of choice rapidly choice is when you can't see a doctor rapidly you go outside you find the doctor you get yourself fixed up and Sarah we pay the Bill and it was a great thing and he said it's rapidly uh not being used not being allowed to be used and you know I think it actually didn't cost I think it was probably in the end we probably saved on it but money isn't the big thing here I think it actually we saved money on it because people would get very very sick these are people that would wait four five six months to see a doctor if you had to wait more than one day you go out you see a doctor we had bills negotiated fees negotiated you know we can't be totally crazy with this because the doctors are pretty good business people I will tell you right but we had a lot of fees negotiated but you go out see your doctor get yourself fixed up and you have no problems it was one of the best things we ever did and now this group of lunatics that don't give a damn about the military they're making you go through that waiting of four five six months again and our people can't hand we have great doctors but they can't handle the loads and we're going to go back we get back in we're going back to that right we're going back to it immediately uh you're going to be in great shape Sarah you and your husband are going to be in great shape and thank you very much incredible thank you Sarah Mr President we actually have someone that and before we ask his question I wanted to read this to the crowd he had actually written a letter to you after you'd been shot in Pennsylvania dear president Trump watching you during the butler rally and you getting back up both my wife and I gave a sigh of relief as well as a few tears I would be honored if you would accept this small token that I received as a young Marine in Vietnam my wife and I both thought it appropriate God bless you your family and the United States of America sincerely Dwight Dwight where you at thank you whoa looks like a check it's a check it's cash for those of you who may not know Dwight had given president Trump his purple heart that's right that's right I could I couldn't thank anybody more deserving have a purple heart thank you very much you took it you laid down there you got back up and the first words out of your mouth was fight fight fight you didn't even have anything to shoot back you got that right there he doesn't do this but he's better than anybody as far as I'm no I'm hardly better than you onestly You're great at us and uh I wanted to thank you I know that most of you all watched the president on that day and was very fearful that some terrible happened when he went down on the ground but it was such a relief our hearts were so filled with joy because we saw what happened and it was a minor wound but it was close to being a terrible you know we were I said I said how does it why was there so much blood to the doctor just bleeding like crazy this is a little fact some of you might have heard this but you get hit in the air in the ear and it bleeds more than any other part of the body so I didn't mind being hit that way I don't want to be hit that way this way this way if I didn't make the turn I would have been hit the other way that's no good that would not have been too good but it is it is true and I got uh very lucky and maybe it wasn't so much luck maybe this something else right maybe there's something else up there but that's great thank you you also you also took the time out to write me a beautiful letter and gave me a challenge I never expected that from the president of the United States thank you very a great honor and I remember it very well when you gave it your question yes I will really nice thank you I I served as a Marine in Vietnam proudly served as a Marine in Vietnam and I thank you very much there was there were quite a few that did and when I came back from the service and stuff like that we didn't get quite the greatest greeting but no you didn't a lot of a lot of the veterans nowadays are homeless there 7% were homeless before Biden Harris took over now there's 14% I would like to know what you're going to do to prevent this from getting any larger and also kicking these illegal aliens out of the freaking hotels and provide them with money before we do it our so interesting so one of the things that most angers me about this is the 21 million people plus you know they say it's 10 it's 12 it's whether it is or not it's much more than that it's 21 million and it's probably with the Goda ways and everything a lot more than that but one of the things that most angers me is that you have veterans on the streets in front of a hotel and you have illegal immigrants some of them are serious killers and drug dealers and all the people that we talked about before and terrorists and those people being walked into a hotel and they're staying in a hotel and they walk by veterans who are sleeping on the street and it could be cold it could be hot and it bothers me if we stop if we close our walls we're going to be able to handle it they are spending so much money on taking care of the illegal migrants now we call them we used to call them illegal aliens I call them whatever the hell I want to call them so do you but they're not supposed to be here and we're going to close the well first day we're going to do a couple of things first day we're going to drill baby drill we're going to close the wall we're going to close it up and we will be we're going to have to take people out we cannot have Killers do we agree does anybody want to leave the murderers the drug dealers in our country do you know you know one of the little facts that's uh very sad but makes sense that all these things I predicted 3 4 years ago I was saying this is going to happen and now it's happening the migrant crime it's a it's a massive it's a massive crime but all of this that's happened everybody it's common sense that it was going to happen and we're going to have to get them out because we have no choice it's not sustainable by any country we have done things that are so stupid like as an example I consider it to be less important but it's very important still because it's a way of life Men playing in women's sports Okay who wants that and who wants open borders cuz open borders are so you say how does a thing like that happen all of these policies we going to be changing and we have now somebody running as a radical left person you know more left by far than Pocahontas more you know who that is more left by far than crazy Bernie Sanders she's more left and we can't have it so we're going to take care of your people and your friends you got a lot of friends out there that don't have a place and we're going to do it or we're going to do it fast so we're going to put money to it first of all we're standing on the greatest power it's called Liquid Gold we have more than any other country we don't use it we get oil and gas now from Venezuela do you believe it we're going to take our own and we're going to make a lot of money so we're going to make a lot of money we're going to take care of our veterans properly we're not going to have that happen anymore okay thank you Dwight thank you beautiful guy beautiful guy I think I'm going to stand this chair is the most uncomfortable chair I've it first of all it spins and the one thing I don't want is to fall in my ass because that's going to be that will be the only story they'll say sir you did great too bad you fell that would be the only story so I'm not sitting in that sucker I think it's a booby trap that was put there by Kamala well that brings me to my next question so you're talking on immigration and border security so we all know that that's tied to National Security and the one thing that ticks me off is you have Camala Harris who runs on the fact that she's a minority woman but yet she's done nothing about the 300,000 migrant children that have gone missing just real quick how many parents are in this room how many women are in this room that support Trump as mothers grandmothers Sisters Wives would you ever tolerate children being trafficked if you were in kamala's position wouldn't you have stopped that President Trump you've done more for not just the Hispanic American Community but I think women in this country not just I'm just going to toot his horn for a second he's put women in positions of power but the media won't cover that they won't because it doesn't fit their narrative they want women to hate them but guess what we don't hate them we love them don't we but I don't do it I don't do it really for a pure really great reason I just do it because I want results and I just find women to be smarter than men does that make sense men you don't mind I do that everyone in a while it's not bad thank you thank you well Mr President to follow up on that question as a grandfather and a father what are you going to do to stop the trafficking of women and children in this country and specifically with the migrant children as well so we had it down to the lowest number you saw that on the graph that included drugs that included trafficking and in women mostly women and children but you mentioned a number to be exact 325,000 now think of that you could fill up the biggest stadiums many times with this 325,000 children are missing during the Biden Reign now let's say her because they made her and you know it's funny when you say Harris right nobody knows who the hell I'm talking about you say the Harris team who nobody knows you have to say Kamala so Cala but Kamala and Biden 325,000 just during this uh almost 4-year reign that's missing but many of them are dead many of them are in sex slavery many of them are slavery period and they're gone and never to be seen probably by their parents again never to be seen their parents are all over the world looking they're looking for them and what we've done here is so horrible 325 can you imagine if that were me where they were missing this would be the biggest Story the fake news media never talks about it you know what they're not talking about and you know Anna you know what they're not talking about they're not talking about something else that's very important they are doing this is Katrina they are doing the worst job on a hurricane than any Administration has ever done and these people don't want to talk about it they don't want to talk about it people are saying it's the worst job and you people know it a lot of you people know it because you're here but they've done the worst job Kamala has done the worst job and it's really like her because she was put in charge now she said I wasn't the Bazar they shouldn't call well she was always the Bazar she never she never went to the Border until a little while ago and then she made a speech like I'm going to start getting very tough why didn't she do it four years ago you know you could always say why didn't and all she had to do is leave our policies we had Brandon Jud we had Tom homman you know Tom Homan I see him a lot he's great like Central casting he was great all these people are great we have great people there right now but we have some tremendous people and you know it's interesting with border patrol and Ice it's really easier for them not to do their job but they love the country they really want to do the job they're so disgusted when they have to let people and you look at some people you know they're criminals and they have to let them go walking right by into our country now we're going to straighten it out it's going to be straightened out right but 300 remember this number 325 5,000 children are missing that means many dead are missing during this Administration and that's almost Unthinkable and I can just imagine if that were us it would be the worst the worst story they never talk about it and the other story they don't talk about and I'm doing this because we want we're in all that television look at all that television the other story they don't talk about is what a rotten job they're doing in North Carolina and other places with respect to the hurricane they are doing a they are doing a terrible  job Mr President to follow up on that because the media is here I do believe that they've intentionally and this is my opinion not helped out those residents because it's red communities that are impacted let's call it spade a spade do your job and do better Anna one one thing so Elon Musk we all love Elon you know Elon we have to take care of our brilliant people we don't have too many of them right there aren't too many brilliant people but I got a call an emergency call two days ago to speak to Elon and he endorsed me very strongly he endorses me almost every day he wants us to win so badly but Elon is a brilliant guy between the Tesla and this that the Rockets but he also does something called you know the link star links so here star links uh now I'm not too familiar with it all I know is it's really supposed to be great so they call because in North Carolina and parts of North and a little bit Georgia but in parts of North Carolina every line is down there was no there was no calls no anything nobody could get through to anybody and I got a call from a big person in North Carolina could you possibly call Elon Musk because we need help with starlink could we get starlinks you know really and I did and he was great and you know he did something was he had it ordered I got a call during my phone call they called me up the people from North Carolina and they said thank you very much for helping us with Mr musk I was talking to him he still he wasn't off the phone I said you have some kind of a thing that we're talking and you're ordering people this was the craziest thing no this he he's like I'm talking to so Elon thank you very much I appreciate it I'll see you he's going to Butler tomorrow you know Elon is going to about but but I asked him about starlings would you be able to get a certain section of Georgia they're going to fly them in with helicopters and everything else would you be able and as I'm talking to them they're calling me in the other line thanking me forgetting it so I got to ask him what the hell that was all about right he's probably got some little contraption that he's going like this as he's talking to him he's incredible that guy I'll tell you but he got a tremendous for Georgia and for North Carolina the starlinks they got here's the one thing they have to do they have to distribute it they have to get it out there he got it here but they have to get it out there they're not getting it out that's FEMA they've got to get it out so important but he's really done a great job so we appreciate it thank you Mr President thank you for all you're doing continuously our next question is from Pete who was a Marine Corps veteran and his question is going to be covering the withdraw of Afghanistan Pete Mr President I am Pete from North Carolina and also a Latino for  Trump I knew I liked him and I proudly served in the United States Marine Corps First as enlisted that's great thank you then as an officer despite what the Vice President says we sadly lost 13 under her watch as sick as me many of my fellow Marines as well as my friend Lieutenant Colonel sheller there has been zero accountability for the terrible withdrawal what will you do to make sure we have accountability for what happened okay it's it's great it's like I know more about that subject than any subject we spoke about because I think it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country uh there was never anything I don't think Putin would have gone in and invaded Ukraine if that didn't happen he saw that he said these people are stupid people they're idiots and you know they only Respect power and force when they saw that uh by the way if I were President Putin would have never done it period and you would have never had the attack and you wouldn't have had inflation and you wouldn't have had the problem that we're talking about because you know I had it down to 5,000 I was getting out they were there for 20 years but a couple of things were done wrong number one they should have kept the military base right buam so you have a military base one of the largest bases in the world we left it it's 1 hour forget about Afghanistan it's 1 hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons okay you got to keep that and they didn't they fled they left we had eight as you know 18 months I called up Abdul Abdul is the head of the Taliban that's the ones that do the shooting okay not not the Afghans it's called the Taliban and the Press said why would you call them because that's where the shooting is and I called him up we didn't have it was nasty we didn't have one soldier killed because they were killing a lot of our soldiers the snipers and a lot of them with the Obama Biden Administration before I got there and a lot of them and I called them up had a rough call and after that call we didn't have one soldier killed for 18 months we didn't have one soldier shot at for 18 months and then we had a terrible election we're not going to let that happen again we can't ever let that happen again we're not going to have a what a shame that was but we had an election and these guys took over and it all started up again and what they did with that withdraw was so bad number one we lost 13 great soldiers and as you know I know the parents of a lot of them but we lost the soldiers we left $85 billion worth of equipment behind we left Americans behind everything was wrong and we embarrassed our country I really mean I think it was most embarrassing the one thing you do is you take the soldiers out last okay they took the soldiers at first a 5-year-old child would tell you that the other thing you do is you fire every General that was involved in that case because those guys were incompetent and you haven't heard the last of that I promise you you have not heard the last of it what a terrible what a terrible thing that was worst one of the most embarrassing me as a person that loves our country that was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country in my opinion thank you we're going to we're going to take care of that I got to get back in Mr Mr President such a good title for him isn't it you you do know she's a congresswoman right and a highly respected one she's actually a killer with her husband the most beautiful baby you've ever seen backstage but she's a congresswoman woman from Florida and I have to say she's a highly respected person thank you Mr President thank you Mr President our next question is from Terry in regards to military pay and Terry is from the 82nd  Airborne Mr President thank you for being here my name is carry I have had the honor of serving with the 8 Mighty 82nd Airborne I'm also a proud member of the Lumby tribe the the largest tribe in North Carolina we have one of the highest percentage of military service in the nation a higher percentage of the overall population my qu my question sir is about military pay you provided the largest pay raise in history to our military unfortunately we have seen inflation Skyrocket and more and more service members and veterans are on fixed incomes and are finding hard it hard to pay for basic Basics like grocery I will commit what will you commit to increase military pay and bring down prices yeah very good Terry I appreciate it too and it's uh very unfair so I gave the largest pay raise in the history of the military and I thought that was wonderful but then when these clowns came came in these incompetent fools came in they allowed inflation and because of the energy policies I think mostly but also because of their spending but they allowed massive inflation so your pay stayed here and you were happy and then all of a sudden the cost of bacon doubled and the cost of everything else doubled and tripled and quadrupled interest rates went to 10% so you could no longer we were at 2% and they went to 10% so you could no longer buy a house so many things happened the answer is yes I'm going to take care of you I'm going to take care of our law enforcement and you know who else I'm going to take care of our teachers our teachers are very underpaid we're going to take care of our teachers okay going to take care and I did it I did it I felt strongly but you know the fact is that that got wiped out what we gave you got wiped out by their inflation that they should have never had that's another thing you would have never had inflation because it was caused largely by really dumb energy the energy went through the sky that brought everything with it so we're going to take care but law enforcement also and your teachers okay thank you Mr President we now have time for one last question so our last question make this a good one our last one comes from ma Matthew Matthew he was a F-15 pilot I won't hold that against  you here I got it Mr President first off I want to speak on behalf of everyone here and say thank you for taking time tonight to speak with our troops thank you thank you very much we got a lot of good-look men in this audience don't we huh and a lot of good-look women also by the way thank you very much okay go ahead I'm going to revisit something you've talked about already my name is Matt l i was an Air Force F-15 pilot and I was a commander in your newly created us space force I am also the first veteran of the space force because under the Biden Harris regime I was fired from my command and lost my pension for criticizing Dei trainings that were rampant in the military those trainings are still dividing our troops and thank you for saying you would fire those few woke generals who are a big problem they gone I'm going to suggest that it might in fact require ongoing oversight and a persistent consistent watchful eye within the Pentagon to ensure this monster never returns to the defense department will you consider establishing a special task force office or position to ensure that these monsters never return to the defense you know what I'll do and I'm pretty good at this stuff sometimes you get it wrong I'm going to put you on that task force I think it's good not going to do better than him I'll put you on make sure you give the name thank you beautiful right I have your approval huh yes sir I have your approval we're not going to get better than him you're right about it you're right 100% thank you I'm cut Mr President that wraps it up for the evening do you have any closing statements to well I just want to say that it was very important that I got to North

4,Donald Trump," thank you very much thank you very very much wow and thank you Dana thank you Kid Rock sometimes referred to as Bob and thank you Lee right from the beginning thank you very much what a talent what a beautiful beautiful s thank you friends delegates and fellow citizens I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence strength and hope four months from now we will have an incredible Victory and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country together we will launch a new era of safety prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race religion color and Creed the Discord and Division in our society must be healed we must heal it quickly as Americans we are bound together by a single fate and a shared Destiny We rise together or we fall apart I am running to be president for all of America not half of America because there is no victory in winning for half of America so tonight with faith and devotion I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States thank you thank you very   much thank you very much and we will do it right going to do it right let me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on  Saturday as you already know the Assassins bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life so many people people have asked me what happened tell us what happened please and therefore I will tell you exactly what happened and you'll never hear it from me a second time because it's actually too painful to tell it was a warm beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  music was loudly playing and the campaign was doing really well I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly everybody was happy I began speaking very strongly powerfully and happily because I was discussing the great job my Administration did on immigration at the southern border we were very proud of it behind me and to the right was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership the numbers were absolutely amazing in order to see the chart I started to like this turn to my right and was ready to begin a little bit further turn which I'm very lucky I didn't do when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really really hard on my right ear I said to myself wow what was that it can only be a bullet and moved my right hand to my ear brought it down my hand was covered with blood just absolutely blood all over the place I immediately knew it was very serious that we were under attack and in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage and they really did they rushed to the stage these are great people at Great risk I will tell you and pounced on top of me so that I would be protected there was blood pouring everywhere and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side I felt  that the amazing thing is that prior to the shot if I had not moved my head at that very last instant the Assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its Mark and I would not be here tonight we would not be together the most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening in the fading sun was actually seen later in almost all cases as you probably know and when even a single bullet is fired just a single bullet and we had many bullets that were being fired crowds Run for the exits or Stampede but not in this case it's very unusual this massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didn't move an inch in fact many of them bravely but automatically stood up looking for where the sniper would be they knew immediately it was a sniper and then began pointing at him you can see that if you look at the group behind me that was just a small group compared to what was in front nobody ran and by not stampeding many lives were saved but that isn't the reason that they didn't move the reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble they saw it they saw me go down they saw the blood and thought actually most did that I was dead they knew it was a shot to the Head they saw the blood and there's an interesting statistic the ears are the bloodiest part if something happens with the ears they bleed more than any other part of the body for whatever reason the doctors told me that I said why is there so much blood he said it's the ears they bleed more so we learned something but they just they just this beautiful crowd they didn't want to leave me they knew I was in trouble they didn't want to leave me and you can see that love written all over their faces incredible people they're incredible people bullets were flying over us yet I felt Serene but now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in Peril they were in very dangerous territory bullets were flying right over them missing them by a very small amount of inches and then it all stopped our secret service sniper from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used took the Assassin's life took him out I'm not supposed to be here tonight not supposed to be here yes you are yes you   are thank you but I'm not and I'll tell you I stand before you in this Arena only by the grace of almighty God in watching the reports over the last few days many people say it was a providential moment probably was when I Rose surrounded by Secret Service the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead and there was great great sorrow I could see that on their faces as I looked out they didn't know I was looking out they thought it was over but I could see it and I wanted to do something to let him know I was okay I raised my right arm looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting fight fight fight thank you once my clenched fist went up and it was high into the air you've all seen that the crowd realized I was okay and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before never heard anything like that for the rest of my life I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of Patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania tragically the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans Cory comparator unbelievable person everybody tells me unbelievable and seriously wounded two other great warriors spoke to them today David Dutch and James copenhaver who great people I also spoke to all three families of the these tremendous people our love and prayers are with them and always will be we're never going to forget them they came for a Great Rally they were serious trumpsters I want to tell you they were serious trumpsters and still are but Corey unfortunately we have to use the past tense he was incredible he was a highly respected former fire chief respected by everybody was accompanied by his wife Helen incredible woman I spoke to her today devastated and two precious daughters he lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets he went right over the top of them and was hit What a fine man he was h  I want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet his outfit and uh it was just something and they're going to do something very special when they get it but we did something which cannot match what happened not even close but I am very proud to say that over the past few days we've raised $6.3 million for the families of David James and Corey including from a friend of mine just called up he sent me a check right here I just got it $1 million from Dan nulan thank you Dan and again when speaking to the family I told them I said well going to be sending you a lot of money but it can't compensate they all said the same thing you're right sir we appreciate so much what you're doing but nothing can take the place in the case of Corey and the other two by the way they were very very seriously injured but now they're doing very well they're going to be okay they're going to be doing very well the Warriors so now I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for others this is the spirit that for Ed America in her Darkest Hours and this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness this is what we need despite such a heinous attack we unite this evening more determined than ever I am more determined than ever and so are you so is everybody in this   thank you thank you very  much our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before nothing will stop me in this Mission because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure no matter what obstacle comes our way we will not break we will not Bend we will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you your family and our magnificent country never and everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul I pledge to our nation tonight thank you very much I pledge that to our nation going to turn our nation around and we're going to do it very quickly thank you this election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful safe free and great again again in an age when our politics too often divide us now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens we are one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all and we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement which is what's been happening in our country lately at a level that nobody has ever seen before in that Spirit the Democrat Party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy especially since that is not true in fact I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country and very big news as you probably just read on Monday a major ruling was handed down from a highly respected federal judge in Florida eileene Cannon finding that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional and the entire case was thrown out of court with all of that publicity thrown out of court if Democrats want to unify our country they should drop these partisan witch hunts which I have been going through for approximately 8 years and they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people we're going to win it anyway but worthy of our people on this journey I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife Melania and Melania thank you very much you also did something really beautiful a letter to America calling for National unity and it really took the Republican Party by surprise I will tell you it was beautiful in fact some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform that would be an honor wouldn't it right Mr Congressman but it captivated so many so I also want to thank my entire family for being here Don Kimberly Ivanka and Jared Eric and Lara Tiffany and Michael Baron we love our Baron and of course my 10 wonderful grandchildren you saw a few of them up there on my lap before and how good was Dana was Dana good me L know was he

the hell to do with it you want to know and then we have my other friend and I've known him so long and we took that song and it was a big success but we made that I saw a chart of great songs to America that was number one on the chart recently number one so that's Lee Greenwood very special beautiful person he's a beautiful man but they all wanted to be here they called and how about the hulster how good was he you see where is he boy oh boy you know they may call it they may call that entertainment I know about entertainment but when he used to lift the 350 pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience I said may be entertainment but he is one strong son of a gun I'm going tell you I watch it many times there aren't a lot of entertainers that can do that right you were fantastic thank you very much followed by Eric what was that all about boy that was good I didn't want to really come up here but he was so great and he's such a good young man he went through a lot of trouble and Don last night was incredible he went through so much trouble they got subpoena more than any people probably in the history of the United States every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats crazy Nancy Pelosi the whole thing just boom boom boom they've got to stop that because they're destroying our country we have to work on making America great again not on beating people and we won we beat them in all we beat them on the impeachments we beat them on indictments we beat them but the time that you have to spend the time that you have to spend if they would devote that genius to helping our country we'd have a much stronger and better country and Jason the biggest star in Country music Jason thank you for being here Jason

this year and by the way Wisconsin we are spending over $250 million here creating jobs and other Economic Development all over the place so I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote I am trying to buy your vote I'll be honest about that and I promise we will make Wisconsin great again we at make thank you Mr Governor thank you very much thank you I'm here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation to every citizen whether you're a young or old man or woman Democrat Republican or independent black or white asian Or Hispanic I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship together we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before we were right there in the first term we got hit with Co we did a great job nobody knew what it was but nobody's ever seen an economy preco and then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to co coming in did a great job never got credit for that we got credit for the war and defeating Isis and so many things the great economy the biggest tax cuts ever the biggest regulation cuts ever the creation of space force the rebuilding of our military we did so much we did so much right to try right to try is a big deal we got right to try they were trying to get that for 52 years somebody's terminally ill and hopefully there's nobody in this audience but it does happen a lot they're terminally ill and they can't use our new space age drugs and other things that we wear Ahad we have the greatest doctors in the world the greatest Laboratories in the world and you can't do it they've been trying to get that approved for 52 years wasn't that easy the insurance companies didn't want to do it they didn't want the risk the labs didn't want to do it because if it didn't work people are pretty far down the line toward death they didn't want to do it the doctors didn't want to have it on their record so I got everybody into an office 52 years they tried sounds simple but it's not and I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will instead of going to Asia Europe or someplace or if you have no money going home and dying just die we got them to sign an agreement agree to it where they're not going to sue anybody they're going to get all of this stuff they're going to get it really fast and what's happened is we're saving thousands and thousands of lives it's incredible right to try it's great feeling under our leadership the United States will be respected again no Nation will question our power no enemy will doubt our might our borders will be Totally Secure our economy will soar we will return Law and Order to our streets patriotism to our schools and importantly we will restore peace stability and Harmony all throughout the world but to achieve this future we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership with we have totally incompetent leadership this will be the most important election in the history of our country under the current Administration we are indeed a nation in Decline we have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable ravaging the incomes of working and lowincome families and crushing just simply crushing our people like never before they've never seen anything like it we also have an illegal immigration crisis and it's taking place right now as we sit here in this beautiful Arena it's a massive Invasion at our Southern border that has spread misery crime poverty disease and destruction to communities all across our land nobody's ever seen anything like it then there is an international crisis the likes of which the world has seldom been part of nobody can believe what's happening war is now raging in Europe in the Middle East a growing Spectre of conflict hangs over Taiwan Korea the Philippines and all of Asia and our planet is teetering on the edge of World War II and this will be a war like no of the war because of Weaponry the weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth shooting at each other these weapons are obliteration it's time for a change this Administration can't come close to solving the problems we're dealing with very tough very Fierce People they're fierce people and we don't have Fierce People we have people that are a lot less than Fierce except when it comes to cheating on elections and a couple of other things then they're fierce then they're fierce so tonight I make this pledge to the great people of America I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy we will drill baby drill  can you believe what they're doing but by doing that we will lead a large scale decline in prices prices will start to come down energy raised it they took our energy policies and destroyed them then they immediately went back to them but by that time so much was lost but we will do it at levels that nobody's ever seen before and we'll end lots of different things we'll start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further we gave you the largest tax cut we'll do it more know people don't realize I brought taxes way down way way down and yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher most people said how did you do that because it was incentive everybody was coming to the country they were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country the companies made it impossible to bring it back the tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great I changed both of them and hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would brought back into our nation and we had an economy the likes of which nobody no Nation had ever seen China we were beating them at levels that were incredible and they know it they know we'll do it again but we'll do it even better I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall most of which I've already built on the wall we were dealing with a very difficult Congress and I said oh that's okay we won't go to Congress I call it an invasion we gave our military almost $800 billion I said I'm going to take a little of that money because this is an invasion and we built most of the wall is already built and we built it through using the funds because what's more what's better than that we have to stop The Invasion into our country that's killing hundreds of thousands of people a year we're not going to let that happen I will end every single intern AAL crisis that the current Administration has created including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine which would have never happened if I was president and the War caused by the attack on Israel which would have never happened if I was President Iran was broke Iran had no money now Iran has $250 billion they made it all over the last 2 and A2 years they were broke I watched the other day on a show called deface the nation has anyone seen it and they had a congressman who was a Democrat say well whether you like them or not Iran was broke dealing with Trump I told China and other countries if you buy from Iran we will not let you do any business in this country and we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100% or more and they said to me well I think that's about it they weren't going to buy any oil and were ready to make a deal Iran was going to make a deal with us and then we had that horrible horrible result that we'll never let happen again the election result we never going to let that happen again they Ed Co to cheat we're never going to let it happen again and they took off all the sanctions and they did everything possible for Iran and now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon which would have never happened this is a shame what what this Administration the damage at this Administration has done and I say it often if you took the 10 worst Presidents in the history of the United States think of it the 10 worst added them up they will not have done the damage that Biden has done only going to use the term once Biden I'm not going to use the name anymore just one time the damage that he's done to this country is Unthinkable it's Unthinkable together we will restore Vision strength confidence and what we're going to have a thing called common sense making most of our decisions actually it's all common sense just a few short years ago under my presidency we had the most secure border and best economy in the history of our country in the history of the world we had the greatest economy in the history of the world we had never done anything like it we were beating every country including China by Leaps and Bounds nobody had seen anything like it we had no inflation soaring incomes we going nobody's nobody can believe it you can't believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse and the world was at peace inflation has been a killer for our country no matter what you make it it doesn't matter because inflation is eating you alive people that were putting away money they were making great wages the highest they've ever made but they were putting away a lot of money now they are just being destroyed they're not putting away anything they're barely living they're going into savings accounts they're taking out their money to live because of inflation inflation remember it's called a country Buster you can go back to Germany from 100 years ago you can go back to any country that suffered great inflation we've suffered the worst inflation we've ever had but go back and see what's happened to those countries we've had the worst inflation we've ever had under this person but in less than 4 years our opponents have turned incredible success into unparallel tragedy and failure it's been a tremendous failure today our cities are flooded with illegal aliens Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken by the way you know who's taking the jobs the jobs that are created 107% of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens and you know who's being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country the black population and the Hispanic population because they're taking the jobs from our black population our Hispanic population and they're also taking them from unions the unions are suffering because of it thank you thank you I like you too thank you very much inflation has wiped out the life savings of our citizens and forced the middle class into a state of depression and despair that's what it is it's Despair and depression we cannot and will not let this continue less than four years ago we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again we're going to be a great nation again thank you with proper leadership every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed and it will be fixed very very quickly so tonight whether you've supported me in the past or not I hope you will support me in the future because I will bring back the American dream that's what we're going to do you don't even hear about the American dream anymore with great humility I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country be excited be excited and by the way the news reports all look at all of those big networks look at them they're all here but every one of them has said this could be the most organized best run and most enthusiastic Convention of either party that they have ever seen every single one and it's true it's true and there's love in the room there's great love in the  room so I better finish strong otherwise we'll blow it and we can't let that happen now this was great all of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run I mean there's not one that I can think of where I said oh gee that wasn't great every single person I refuse to be the only one don't do that to me they're already getting ready see I gave him an idea now we had a this was a great convention this was uh I think we're actually going to go home and miss it you know usually with a con first of all look at these crowds you'd never have this at a convention look at these crowds love it's about love this week the entire Republican party has formally adopted an agenda for America's renewal and you saw that agenda and it's very short compared to the long boring meaningless agendas of the past including the Democrats they write these things that are hundreds of pages long and they never read them after they done in their case fortunately they don't read them because they're pretty bad it's a series of bold promises that we will swiftly Implement when you give us a republican house and Mr speaker thank you very much we have our great speaker of the house with us tonight Mr speaker thank you very much thank you hey Republican Senate we have many senators here and send me back to our beautiful white house just a few short months from now we're talking about just months it can't come fast enough we have to get it done first we must get economic relief to our citizens starting on day one we will drive down prices and make America affordable again we have to make it affordable it's not affordable people can't live like is under this Administration our current Administration groceries are up 57% gasoline is up 60 and 70% mortgage rates have quadrupled and the fact is it doesn't matter what they are because you can't get the money anywhere can't buy houses young people can't get any financing to buy a house the total household costs have increase an average of $228,000 per family under this Administration Republicans have a plan to bring down prices and bring them down very very rapidly by slashing energy costs we will in turn reduce the cost of Transportation manufacturing and all household goods so much starts with energy and remember we have more Liquid Gold under our feet than any other country by far we are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute Fortune with its energy we have it and China does it under the Trump Administration just three and A2 years ago we were energy independent but soon we will actually be better than that we will be energy dominant and Supply not only ourselves but we will supply the rest of the world with numbers that nobody has ever seen and we will reduce our debt 36 trillion we will start reducing that and we will also reduce your taxes still further next and by the way they want to raise your taxes four times think of it and all my life I grew up watching politicians I always love politics I guess I was on the other side I'd watched Pol and they were always talking about we will give you a tax cut we will give you a tax cut we my whole life I was watching I will give you a tax cut right Mr Congressman that's all they talked about this is the only Administration that said we're going to raise your taxes by four times what you're paying now and people are supposed to vote for them I've never heard it you're paying too much we're going to reduce your taxes still further we gave you the biggest one as I said we're going to give you more and it's going to lead to tremendous growth we want growth in our country that's what's going to pay off our debt and next we will end the ridiculous and actually in incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis they spent trillions of dollars on things having to do with the green new scam it's a scam and that's caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy and all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent we will redirect that money for important projects like roads Bridges dams and we will not allow it to be spent on meat meaningless green new scam ideas and I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one thereby saving the US Auto industry from complete obliteration which is happening right now and saving us customers thousands thousand and thousands of dollars per car and right now as we speak large factories just started are being built across the border in Mexico so with all the other things happening our border and they're being built by China to make cars and to sell them into our country no tax no anything the United aut workers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single aut worker Union and non union should be voting for Donald Trump because we're going to bring back car manufacturing and we're going to bring it back fast they're building some of the largest Auto plants anywhere in the world think of it in the world we're going to bring it back we're going to make them we don't mind the we don't mind that happening but those plants going to be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants and if they don't agree with us we'll put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200% on each car and they will be unsalable in the United States we have long been taken advantage of by other countries and think of it often times these other countries are cons considered so-called allies they've taken advantage of us for years we lose jobs we lose revenue and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses wipe out our people I stopped it for four years I stopped it and we're really ready to make changes like nobody had seen before and remember usmca I got rid of NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with usmca which is they say the best trade deal ever made actually probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China where they buy $50 billion worth of our product they were buying nothing they buy $50 billion worth they had to but I don't even talk about it because of Co I don't even mention it frankly because of what happened with the China  virus we will not let countries come in take our jobs and plunder our nation they come into the they plunder our nation the way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America very simple Build It in America and odly in America  and this very simple formula and Congress has to go along with us and they will this very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs we will take over the Auto industry again and many many hundreds of thousands of jobs we lost so many jobs over the years if you go back 20 25 years they've stolen going to China and Mexico about 68% of our Auto industry manufacturing jobs we're going to get them all back we're going to get them all back every one of them at the center of our plan for economic relief are massive tax cuts for workers that include something else that's turned out to be very popular actually here it's very popular in this building and all those hotels that I saw that are so nice I'm staying in a nice one it's called no tax on tips no tax on tips no tax on tips I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where we're leading by about 14 points hello I'll see you there very soon everybody we're having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the strip and it's a great building and the waitress comes over how's everything going really nice person how's everything oh Sarah it's so tough the government's after me all the time on tips tips tips I said well they give you cash would they be able to find them she said actually and I didn't know this she said very little cash is given it's all put right on the check and they come in and they take so much of our money it's just ridiculous and they don't believe anything we say and they've just hired as you know 88,000 agents to to go after him even  more and I said this shows the level of my you know most people go out they hire Consultants they pay millions of dollars but I said to her let me just ask you a question would you be happy if you had no tax on tips she said what a great idea I got my information from a very smart waitress that's better than spending billions of dollars and everybody everybody loves it waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody it's a large large group of people that are being really hurt badly they make money let them keep their money I'm going to protect Social Security and Medicare Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people by the millions they're coming in they're going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things and you're not able to afford they are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare under my plan incomes will Skyrocket inflation will vanish completely jobs will come roaring back and the middle class will prosper like never ever before and we're going to do it very rapidly but no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant Invasion the worst that's ever been seen anywhere in the world there's never been an invasion like this anywhere third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen The Invasion at our Southern border we will stop it and we will stop it quickly you heard Tom homman yesterday Tom homman put him in charge and just sit back and  watch Brandon Jud a border patrol he's incredible these guys that you know they they really their job is a lot easier if they don't have to do anything but they want to their Patriots Brandon Jud border patrol ice ice goes out you have to see what ice does with MS13 you have these These are probably the worst gang and Ice goes in there and I know a lot of people in these rows here and they're very tough people but they don't want to do this job they'll go into a pack of MS13 Killers they're the worst probably the worst gangs in the world we have thousands of them I move thousands and thousands out in my four years we moved them out and it was a pleasure but ice would go right into a pack of these killers and you see fists flying you see everything flying and then they take them they put them in a Patty wagon they take them back and they get them out of our country and the other countries weren't accepting them back and I called up and I said tell them that we're not giving them economic aid anymore and the next day I got calls from all of these countries that were terminated billions of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does US frankly no good and the next day I was called by everybody I couldn't take all the call sir sir what's the problem I said you won't take your Killers back that you sent in Caravans into America you won't take them back well sir uh if you'd like us to we would give very serious consideration to doing that and within 24 hours they were being taken back for years and years when I first came in they said President Obama tried to get him to go back and they wouldn't accept him they' put planes on the runway so you couldn't lead the plane they'd closed the road so you couldn't take the buses it all have to turn back as soon as I said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that they called back and they said sir it would be our great honor to take MS13 we love them very much we love them very much sir we'll take them back at the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border Nightmare and fully restore the sacred and Sovereign borders of the United States of America and we're going to do that on day one that means two things in day one right drill baby drill and close our borders and by the way way and I think everybody as a republican as a patriot in this room and most Democrats we want people to come into our country but they have to come into our country legally Legally less than four years ago I handed this Administration the strongest Border in American history but you can see on the chart that saved my life that was the chart that saved my life I said look it I'm so proud of it I think it's one of the greatest it was done by the border patrol one of the greatest charts I've ever seen it showed everything just like that you know the chart oh there it is that's pretty good wow last time I put up that chart I never really got to look at it but without that chart I would not be here today never got to look at it I said you got to see this chart I was so proud of it and by the time I got to there I never got to see it that day but I'm seeing it now and I was very proud if you look at the arrow on the bottom that's the lowest level the one on the bottom he heavy red arrow that's the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history right there and that was my last week in office and then you see what happened after I left look at the rest and if you go out a little bit further it's getting to be a little bit old but I love it anyway right but you can go much higher with those numbers look what happened right after that The Invasion began we had the opposite that we stopped The Invasion but the invasion that we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left look at what happened after I left they took over our country we ended all catch and release we shut down Asylum fraud we stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign soil we want them to stay on their soil under the Trump Administration if you came in illegally you were apprehended immediately and you were deported you went right back the current Administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that I put in place to seal the Border I wanted to seal border again come in but come in Legally you know how unfair it is so many people hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into our country and now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented so unfair and we're not going to do it we're not going to stand for it they suspended wall construction ended remain in Mexico we had a policy remain in Mexico you think that was easy to get from the Mexican Government but I said you must give it to us if you don't give it to us there will be repercussions and they gave it to us but not easy cancelled our safe third agreements demolished title 42 implemented Nationwide Catch and Release let Catch and Release where we catch them and release them into our country I had we catch them and release them into Mexico there's a slight difference and took 93 this is the previous administration 93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world the entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish Administration the greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country they are coming in from every corner of the earth not just from South America but from Africa Asia the Middle East they're coming from everywhere they're coming at levels that we've never seen before it is an invasion indeed and this Administration does absolutely nothing to stop them they're coming from prisons they're coming from jails they're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums I you know the Press is always on me because I say this has anyone seen Silence of the Lambs the late great Hannibal lecta he'd love to have you for dinner that's insane asylums they're emptying out their inane asylums and terrorists are coming in at numbers that we've never seen before bad things are going to happen meanwhile our crime rate is going up while crime statistics all over the world are going down because they're taking their criminals they're putting them into our country a certain country and I happen to like the president of that country very much but he's been getting great publicity because he's a wonderful Shepherd of the country he says how well the country is doing because their crime rate is down and he said he's training all of these rough people they're rough rough rough he's training them and I've been reading about this for two years I think oh that's wonderful let's take a look at it but then I realized he's not training them he's sending all of his criminals his drug dealers his people that are in jails he's sending them all to the United States and he's different in that he doesn't say that he's trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country well he doesn't do a wonderful job and by the way have I ran one of the countries many countries many many countries from all over I would be worse than any of them I would have had the place totally emptied out already  but we become a Dumping Ground for the rest of the world which is laughing at us they think we're stupid and they can't believe that they're getting away with what they're getting away with but they're not going to be getting away with it for long that's what I can tell you in Venezuela karacus high crime high crime karacus Venezuela really dangerous place but not anymore because in Venezuela crime is down 72% in fact if they would ever win this election I hate to even say that we will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe our cities our cities will be so unsafe we won't be H we will not be able to have it there in El Salvador MERS are down by 70% why are they down now he would have you convinced that because he's trained murderers to be wonderful people no they're down because they're sending their murderers to the United States of America this is going to be very bad and bad things are going to happen and you're seeing it happen all the time that's why to keep our family safe the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country even larger than that of President Dwight D Eisenhower from many years ago you know he was a moderate but he believed very strongly in borders he had the largest deportation operation we've ever had just recently I spoke to The Grieving mother of Joselyn Nary a wonderful woman a precious 12-year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up assaulted and strangled to death after walk to the convenience store just a block away from her house her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow Creek found by some onlookers who couldn't believe what they had witnessed charged with joselyn's heinous murder or two illegal aliens from Venezuela who came across our border were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible horrible administ ation that we have right now I also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister of Rachel Moren Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered while out on a run she wanted to keep herself in good shape it was very important to her she was murdered the monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was led into America by the White House this White House let them in he then attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in Maryland traveled all throughout the country doing tremendous damage Rachel's mother will never be the same I spent time with her she will never be the same I've also met with the wonderful family of lake and Riley the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student she was so proud of being first in her class who was out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted beaten and horrifically killed yet another American life was stolen by a Criminal Alien set free by this Administration and these were incredible people we're talking about these were incredible people who died tonight America This Is My Vow I will not let these killers and criminals into our country I will keep our sons and daughters safe as we bring security to our streets we will help bring stability to the world I was the first president in modern times to start no new Wars you know we were the toughest we were the most respected and you you saw this hungry strong country run by a very powerful tough leaders tough guy press doesn't like him because he's tough and uh he came out recently they were asking him at an interview the whole world is exploding what's happening what's going on Victor orbon prime minister of Hungary very tough  man he said I don't want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers and killing people but they said to them tell us what's going wrong what's happening what is it he said there's only one way you're going to solve it you got to bring president Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody at  Bay he used a word I wouldn't use because I can't use that word because you'd say it was bragados as the Press would say he was a bragard I'm not a bragger but Victor Orban said it he said Russia was afraid of him China was afraid of him everybody was afraid of him nothing was going to happen the whole world was at peace and now the world is blowing up around us all of these things that you read about were not going to happen under President Bush Russia invaded Georgia under President Obama Russia took Crimea under the current Administration Russia is after all of Ukraine under President Trump Russia took nothing we defeated 100% of Isis in Syria and Iraq something that was said to take five years sir it will take five years Years sir we did it in a matter of a couple of months we have a great military our military is not woke it's just some of the fools on top that are  woke I got along very well North Korea Kim Jong-un I got along very well with him the Press hated when I said that how could you get along with him well you know it's nice to get along with somebody has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise is it see in the old days they say that's a wonderful thing now they say how could you possibly do that but now I got along with them and we stopped the missile launchers from North Korea now North Korea is acting up again but when we get back I get along with him he'd like to see me back too I think he misses me if you want to know the truth our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a a planet of War we're a planet of war look at that attack on Israel look at what's happening with Ukraine the cities are just bombed out how can people live like that where buildings massive buildings are falling to the ground it began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan the worst humiliation in the history of our country we have never had a humiliation like that 13 heroic US service members were tragically and needlessly killed 45 others were horrifically wounded nobody ever talks about them no arms no legs face explosions horrifically horrifically wounded and by the way we have a man in this room who's running for the US Senate from a great state Nevada Named Sam Brown who paid the ultimate price thank you Sam thank you Sam thank you he paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office and I think he's going to do great he's running against a person that is not good not respected a total lightweight but Sam I think paid really we were talking about it with some of the Senators that are working so hard for Sam but he paid the biggest price of any Senator ever to run for the Senate I don't think anybody's ever what he did he was a real hero a really great person and he's running and I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam  Brown and we also left behind $85 billion worth of military equipment along with many American citizens were left behind many many American citizen emboldened by that disaster Russia invaded Ukraine they saw this group of people that were incompetent we took the soldiers out first no no we're going to take the soldiers out second if they would have followed my plan we had a great plan but the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly and they weren't doing things perfectly so we said it doesn't kick in you know 18 months in a fistan we didn't have one s they were killing them left and right snipers and I spoke to the head of the Taliban you've heard this story Abdul still there still the head of the Taliban the presscot on me why would you speak to him I said because that's where the killing is I don't have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it and I told him don't ever do that don't ever do that again don't ever ever do that again you're got to stop because during the the Obama Administration many great people and soldiers but a lot of soldiers were being killed from long distance I said if you keep doing that you're going to be hit harder than anybody's ever been hit by a country before and he said I understand your Excellency call me your Excellency I wonder if he calls the other guy your Excellency I doubt it the other guy gave him everything I mean what kind of a deal was that he walked out gave him everything do you know that right now Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the world they're selling the brand new beautiful weapons that we gave them but think of it he actually said to me but why but why do you show me a picture of my home I said you'll have to ask your people or one of your wives but he could figure it out and for 18 months we had not one attack on an American Soldier by the Taliban 18 and then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed I was not there because of a ridiculous election but we had that horrible attack and uh they also gave up bam one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world air bases anywhere in the world the longest runways most powerful hardened thickened runways we gave it up and I liked it not because of Afghanistan I liked it because of China it's one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons and you know who has it now China has it now we were keeping that and now China is likewise circling Taiwan and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba do you know that no the Press refuses to write about it if that were me running this country and we had nuclear submarines in Cuba I will tell you that headlines every day would be what's wrong with our president you don't even hear this you're not hearing about this Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away Mr congressman from Miami by by the way happens to be here correct in Cuba and that would not be stood for if it were somebody else they don't even me they don't want to mention it but now maybe they will and the entire world I tell you this we want our hostages back and they better be back before I assum office or you will be paying a very big price with our victory in November the years of war weakness and Chaos will be over I don't have wars I had no Wars other than Isis which I defeated but that was a war that was started we had no Wars I could stop Wars with a telephone call could stop Wars with just a telephone for if properly stated it would never start we will replenish our military and build an iron Dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland and this great Iron Dome will be built entirely in the USA we're going to build it the USA and Wisconsin Wisconsin just like I gave you that massive ship contract and you're doing a very nice job Governor right thank you governor and they're doing a great job in fact I had a little design change we gave them a tremendous for essentially what we used to call destroyers these are now the most beautiful they look like yachs I said we have to take the bow and we have to make it a little nicer and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose and the people at the shipyard said this guy sort of knows what what he's doing we most beautiful ships right governor and everybody sitting over there and it was a big contract that everybody wanted I gave it to Wisconsin but we're going to have a lot of that built right here and the state of Wisconsin and all other states Israel has an Iron Dome they have a missile defense system 342 missiles were shot into Israel and only one got through a little bit it was badly wounded it fell to the ground but most of them are and Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago but we really didn't have the technology many years ago remember they called it Starship spaceship anything to mock him but he was a very good president very very good but now we have unbelievable technology and why should other countries have this and we don't no no we're going to build an iron Dome over our country and we're going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people and again from an econom IC development standpoint we're going to make it all right here no more sending it out to other countries in order to help it's America First America first we will Unleash the Power of American innovation and as we do we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer Alzheimer's disease and many other diseases we're going to get to the bottom of it you remember this gentleman that I don't want to mention other than one time I had to because when you say you're the 10 worst I had to do it I didn't want anybody to be confused but this man said we're going to find the cure to cancer nothing happened we're going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimer's and so many other things we're so close to doing something great but we need a leader that will let it be done we will not have men playing in women's sports that will end immediately and we will restore and renovate our nation's once great cities making them safe clean and beautiful again and that includes our nation's capital which is a horrible killing field so many things they leave from Wisconsin they go to look at the Washington Monument they end up getting stabbed killed or shot we will be very soon very proud of of our Capital again Washington DC America is on the cusp of a new golden age but we will have the courage to seize it we're going to take it we're going to make it urrent I mean we're going to bring this into a golden age like never seen before remember this China wants to do it Japan wants to do it all of these countries want to do it we have to produce Mass massive amounts of energy if we're going to produce the new if you look at some of the things that have been done and some of the things that we're going to do but AI needs tremendous T literally twice the electricity that's available now in our country can you imagine but instead we're spending places where they recharge electric cars they built eight chargers at a certain location toward the Midwest eight charges for $9 billion think of them as a tank for filling up your gas think of it they spent $9 billion on eight charges three of which didn't work and if you were going to do this all over our country this crazy electric mandate if you're going to do this all and by the way I'm all for electric they have their application but if somebody wants to buy a gas powered car gasoline powered car or a hybrid they're going to be able to do it and we're going to make that change on day one so to conclude just a few short days ago my journey with you nearly ended we know that and and yet here we are tonight all gathered together talking about the future promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much it's called America we live in a world of Miracles none of us knows God's plan or where life's Adventure will take us I want to thank Franklin graah for being here tonight he's an outstanding man he wrote me a note recently I have a lot of respect for him sir I love your storytelling I think it's great in front of these big rallies but sir please do me one favor it won't make any difference please don't use any foul language I was a little embarrassed I said he said it won't make any different actually it does the story is not quite as good but I've been very good the story is not quite as good to be honest I've got to have a little talk with Franklin but he was great he's a great gentleman his father was so incredible Billy Graham my father used to love taking me to see Billy grah my father would take me to see Billy grah at Yankee Stadium he had the biggest rallies you've ever seen he was a good rally guy too but he'd get up and he was a fantastic guy my father loved Billy Graham but I love Franklin graah I think Franklin's been fantastic and I'm trying I'm working so hard to adhere to his note to me me I'm working hard on it Franklin but if the events of last Saturday make anything clear it is that every single moment we have on Earth is a gift from God we have to make the most of every day for the people and for the country that we love the attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement but the truth is the movement has never been about me it has always been about you it's your movement it's the biggest movement in the history of our country by far can't be St it can't be stopped it has always been about the hardworking patriotic citizens of America for too long our nation has settled for too little we settled for too little we've given everything to other nations to other people you have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families I am here tonight with the opposite message your expectations are not big enough not big enough it is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world leadership that is bold Dynamic Relentless and fearless we can do that we are Americans ambition is our heritage greatness is our Birthright but as as long as our energies are spent fighting each other our destiny will remain Out Of Reach and that's not acceptable we must instead take that energy and use it to realize our country's true potential and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story we can do it together we will unite we are going to come together and success will bring us together it is a story of love sacrifice and so many other things and remember the word devotion it's unmatched devotion our American ancestors crossed the Delaware survived the icy winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty Empire to establish our cherished Republic they fought so hard they lost so many they pushed thousands and thousand thousands of miles across a dangerous Frontier taming the Wilderness to build a life and a magnificent home for their family they packed their families into covered wagons treed across hazardous Trails scaled towering mountains and braved rivers and Rapids to stake their claim on the wide open new and very beautiful Frontier when our way of life was threatened American Patriots marched onto the the battlefield raced into enemy strongholds and stared down death and stared down those enemies to keep alive the flame of Freedom at Yorktown Gettysburg and Midway they joined the roll call of immortal Heroes so many hor just so many Heroes so many great great people and we have to cherish those people we can't forget those people we have to cherish those people and building monuments to those great people is a good thing not a bad thing they saved our country no challenge was too much no hardship was too great no enemy was too Fierce together these Patriots Soldier all and endured and they prevailed because they had faith in each other faith in their country and above all they had faith in their  God just like our ancestors we must now come together rise above past differences any disagreements have to be put aside and go forward United as one people one nation pledging allegiance to one great beautiful I think it's so beautiful American flag tonight I ask for your partnership for your support and I am humbly asking for your vote want you vote going to make our country great again every day I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in me and I will never ever let you down I promise that I will never let you down to all of the Forgotten men and women who have been neglected abandoned and left behind you will be forgotten no longer we will press forward and together we will win win  win win win win win win win nothing will sway us nothing will slow us and no one will ever stop us no matter what dangers come our way no matter what obstacles lie in our path we will keep striving toward our shared and glorious Destiny and we will not fail we will not fail together we will save this country we will restore the Republic and we will usher in the rich and wonderful tomorrows that our people so truly deserve America's future will be bigger better Bolder brighter happier stronger Freer greater and more united than ever before and quite simply put we will very quickly make America great again thank you very much thank you very much Wisconsin God bless you God bless you Wisconsin and God bless the United States of America our great country thank you very much everybody thank you",RNC Convention,2024/7/19,Youtube
5,Donald Trump," well thank you very much appreciate your being here uh just a statement before I talk about debates I think that our country is right now in the most dangerous position it's ever been in from an economic standpoint from a safety standpoint uh both gangs on the street and frankly gangs outside of our country in the form of other countries that are frankly very powerful they're very powerful countries and we don't know what we're doing we have leaders ship that has no clue how to handle them or how to handle any other situation we have a uh we have a lot of bad things coming up you could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety which would be a devastating thing took many years took decades to recover from it uh and we're very close to that we're very close to a World War in my opinion we're very close to a World War we have people that don't know how to handle it uh they're not respected all over the world left at and we can't have that most dangerous period of time I've ever seen for our country with that being said uh we have somebody that hasn't received one vote for president and she's running and that's fine with me but we were given Joe Biden and now we're given somebody else and I think frankly I'd rather be running against somebody else but that was their choice they decided to do that because uh kamala's record is horrible she's a radical left person at a level that nobody's seen she picked a radical left uh man that is uh he's got things done that he's he has positions that are just not it's not even possible to believe that they exist uh he's going for things that nobody's ever even heard of heavy into the transgender world heavy into lots of different worlds having to do with safety he doesn't want to have borders he doesn't want to have walls he doesn't want to have any form of safety for our country he doesn't mind people coming in from prisons and neither does she I guess because she's not she couldn't care less she's the Bazar by the way she was the Bazar 100% and all of a sudden for the last few weeks she's not the Bazar anymore like nobody ever said it and I just hope that the uh media becomes more diligent more honest frankly because if they're not going to be honest it's going to be much tougher to bring our country back we have a very very sick country right now uh you saw the other day with the stock market crashing that was just the beginning that was just the beginning it's going to get worse it's going to get a lot worse in my opinion and uh fortunately we've had some very good polls over the last fairly short period of time Ras M came out today we're substantially leading and others came out today that we're leading and in some cases substantially I guess Ms NBC came out or CNBC came out also with a poll that was you has us leading and leading fairly big in swing States in some polls I'm leading very big in swing States because they want safety people want safety they want security they want respect all around the world for our country they don't want this this horrible uh culture that is developing a culture of no common sense it's really a culture of no common sense and it's not what anyone wants we want to have a safe country we want to have a strong military we want low interest rates and we want to be able to have the American dream we want to be able to have our youth be able to buy homes housing get good jobs and we're really just at the opposite right now it's so it's so sad to see but as a bordar she's been the worst bordar in history in the world history I think the number is 20 million but whether it's 15 or 20 it's numbers that nobody's ever heard before 20 million people came over the Border in the last during the Biden Harris Administration 20 million people and it could be very much higher than that nobody really knows what the number is nobody knows nobody has a clue and uh the Goa ways they call them the Goda ways the Goda ways are at numbers somebody was quizzing me on it the other day no no I don't think so sir I don't think so uh they have no idea what those numbers are but they're much higher than you would think just just like far more people were killed in the Ukraine Russia War than you ever report just like the October 7th would have never happened Russia would have never hit Ukraine had the election result been called differently uh it was a very bad call but Russia would not have attacked Ukraine October 7th in Israel would have never happened you wouldn't have inflation a lot of great things would have happened but now you have millions and millions of dead people and you have people dying financially because they can't buy bacon they can't buy food they can't buy groceries they can't do anything and uh they're living horribly in our country right now with all of that being said I think it's very important to have debates and we've agreed with Fox on a date of September 4th we've agreed with NBC fairly full agreement subject to them on September 10th and we've agreed with ABC on September 25th so we have those three dates and uh those networks uh they're very anxiously awaiting that date and those dates uh so we have SE September 4th September 10th and September 25th we have spoken to the heads of the network and it's all been confirmed uh other than uh some fairly Minor Details audience uh some location which which city would we put it into but all things that will be settled very easily very I think it would be very easy uh the other side has to agree to the terms they may or may not agree I don't know if they're going to agree they she hasn't done an interview she can't do an interview she's barely competent and she can't do an interview but I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight why is it that millions of people were allowed to come into our country from prisons from jails from mental institutions insane asylums even insane as that's a uh it's a mental institution on steroids that's what it is when you see the people that are coming into our these are institutions that are being emptied out not in South America all over the world including South America all over the world prisons are being emptied out into our country because we have a president that's the worst president in the history of our country we have a vice president who is the least admired least respected and the worst vice president in the history of our country the most unpopular vice president and because of political reasons or because of uh being politically correct even though she never received a vote don't forget she was the first one defeated as I remember it because I watched it very closely but she was the first one she never made it to Iowa the first state she never made it to Iowa she was the first one that was defeated she was the nastiest to him she was nasty with the calling him a racist and the school bus and all of the different things she was very nasty to Biden and shockingly he appointed her asked her to serve as vice president well uh I don't know if he's happy about that decision right now this was taken away the presidency was taken away from Joe Biden and I'm no Biden fan but I tell you what from a constitutional standpoint from any standpoint you look at they took the president away and people were saying he lost after the debate he couldn't win well I don't know that that's true necessarily but whether he could win or he couldn't when he had the right to run and they took it away they said they're going to use the 25th Amendment they're going to hit you hard either we can do it the nice I heard I know exactly because I know a lot of people on the other side believe it or not and uh they said we'll do it the nice way we'll do it the hard way and he said all right so that they've really taken what they've done is pretty incredible uh and now I'm running against somebody else and we're leading we're leading so I'm not complaining I'm saying it's a for a country with a constitution that we cherish we cherish this constitution to have done it this way is pretty severe pretty horrible uh you would have thought they would have gone out to a vote they would have had a primary system they would have done something but to just take it away from him uh like he was a child and he's a very angry man right now I can tell you that he's not happy with Obama and he's not happy with Nancy Pelosi crazy Nancy she is crazy too she's not happy with any of the people that told him that you've got to leave he's very unhappy very angry and I think he also blames her he's trying to put up a good face but it's a very bad thing in terms of a country when you do that I'm not a fan of his as you probably have noticed and he had a rough debate but that doesn't mean that you just take it away like that you or you go out to a vote you do something he had 14 million votes she had no votes she got no votes and uh I think she's crashing I think when people find out and I think people are starting to find out what a bad job she did what a bad job she did On the Border she's trying to say she had nothing to do with the Border she had everything she was appointed to head the border and then they said borders are oh she loved that name she loved that name but she never went there she went to a location once along the border but that was location that you would love to go and have dinner with your husband or whoever that was a uh location that was not part of the problem that was not really going to the border so I essentially she never went to the border and if you listen to Tom Holman if you listen to the great border people Brandon Jud from border patrol if you listen to Paul I mean so many different people I speak to them all the time and I did when I was President we had the best Border in the history of our country country now we have the worst Border in the history of the world millions of people coming in and our country cannot sustain it our country is going down because of this because of incompetent people so I just look forward to these debates I think it's very important that we have them I hope she agrees to them September 4th September 10th September 25th and uh I think they'll be very revealing I think they'll be very revealing do you have any questions please how you I haven't recalibrated strategy at all uh it's the same policies open borders weak on crime she's I think she's worse than Biden because he got forced into the position she was there long before she destroyed San Francisco she destroyed California as the AG but as the da she destroyed s she San Francisco friend of mine Bob Tish you you know all know the Tish family was in many cities with companies he said the greatest city in the country is San Francisco that was about 20 years ago and he passed away a while ago and he would be looking down and said what happened he thought it was the best city in the country he had divisions there lows and uh he would be looking down in horror now when he sees she destroyed no cash bail weak on crime uh she terrible and yet they weaponized the system against me they have me I got so many lawyers now they want to delay cases I won the big case in Florida I won the big case nobody even wrote about it the big case the judge was a brilliant judge and all they do is they play The Ref with the judges this judge was a fair but brilliant judge and as you probably heard the big documents case I won it now Biden lost it because he didn't have pres presidential immunity he didn't have the president IAL records act he lost it but the special I call it prosecutor special counsel special prosecutor to me he uh appointed by him and appointed by Garland he said the man's incompetent he can't stand tril but he can run for president but we no longer have to worry about that because we have somebody that in my opinion is more incompetent she couldn't pass her bar exam and lots of other things and she should not be in a position because if she becomes president our country is going to be a giant fail it's going to fail it's going to be a failure the likes of which this world has never seen yeah please no how about you you have to speak louder yeah well it changes around a little bit I'm getting other voters uh perhaps you know I was doing very well with black voters and I still am uh I seem to be doing very well with black males this is according to polls as you know uh it's possible that it won't do as well well with black women but I do seem to be doing very well with other segments uh extremely well with Hispanic uh Jewish voters way up white males way up white males have gone through the roof white males way up uh now I don't know all we're doing is giving you the the stats that you have uh it could be that I'll be affected somewhat with uh black females where we're doing pretty well and I think ultimately they'll like me better because I'm going to give them secur safety and jobs I'm going to give them a good economy we have a very bad economy right now we could we could literally be on the throws of a depression not recession a depression and they can't have that they can't have that so I think I'm going to do well with everybody especially when the facts out yeah please in the back well I don't know I know Josh Shapiro he's a terrible guy and he's is not very popular with anybody I think that this uh this election maybe is better than Josh Shapiro would have been but I think other than Josh Shapiro I think she had some good choices but Josh Shapiro is not one of them he's uh caused a lot of damage with a lot of people and uh I don't think he would have been better I think he would have been maybe the equivalent maybe not as good but they had some people that they were looking at that were good far superior to her they actually had a story where they had everybody including they had like 10 people that she was looking at and her and they said she was the worst of all in other words she was the worst out of the 10 people enter I don't know how that's going to work out uh we'd like to do three debates we think we should do three debates we think Fox and ABC and we also have CBS who's going to do the vice presidential debate so CBS will do vice presidential and uh and I have to tell you JD Vance has really stepped up he's doing a fantastic job say it oh give me a break listen I had 107,000 people in New Jersey you didn't report it I'm so glad you ask what dides she have yesterday 2,000 people if I ever had 2,000 people you'd say my campaign is finished it's so dishonest the press and and here's a great example I had in Michigan recently 25,000 people and 25,000 people were just we just couldn't get them in we had in Harrisburg 20 25,000 people and 20,000 people couldn't get in we had so many nobody ever mentions that when she gets 1500 people and I saw it yesterday on ABC which they said oh the crowd was so big I have 10 times 20 times 30 times the crowd size and no they never say the crowd was big that's why I'm always saying Turn Around the cameras I'm so glad you asked that I think it's so terrible when you say well she has 1500 people a thousand people and they talk about oh the enthusiasm let me tell you we have the enthusiasm the Republican party and me as a candidate but the Republican party has the enthusiasm because people want to see crime stopped they want to see a country that's respected think of it if I were president you wouldn't have Russia and Ukraine where never happened zero chance you wouldn't have had October 7th of Israel you wouldn't have the horrible uh withdrawal and I don't mean the withdrawal because the withdrawal was fine I was ready to withdraw from Afghanistan and we were going to do it with dignity and strength and we were going we were keeping our equipment we weren't leaving $85 billion worth of equipment behind and we wouldn't have had 13 great soldiers I know the families of those soldiers well we wouldn't have had these soldiers killed and we wouldn't have had 45 45 soldiers obliterated no legs no arms the face none of that would have happened and you wouldn't have had inflation you wouldn't have had any inflation because inflation was caused by their bad energy problems now they've gone back to the Trump thing because they need the votes they you know they I don't know if you know they're drilling now because they had to go back because uh gasoline was going up to $789 a barrel so they said we better do what Trump but the day after the election if they won you're going to have fuel prices go through the roof everybody's going to be forced to buy an electric car which they're not going to do because they don't want that it's got a great Market it's got a market it's really a submarket people want gasoline propelled cars they want hybrids they want to have everything and they want electric but they want everybody to have an electric car we don't have enough electricity we couldn't make enough electricity for that and you know what else uh the weight of a car the weight of a truck they want all trucks to be electric little things that a lot of people don't talk about the weight of a truck is two and a half times it's two and a half times heavier you would have to rebuild every bridge in this country if you were going to do this ridiculous policy so uh but on crowd size in history for any country nobody's had crowds like I have and you know that that and when she gets a thousand people and everybody starts jumping you know that if I had a thousand people would say people would say that's the end of his campaign I have hundreds of thousands of people in uh South Carolina I had 88,000 people in Alabama I had 68,000 people nobody says about crowd siiz with me but she has a thousand people or 1500 people and they say oh the enthusiasm is back no no the enthusiasm is with me and the Republican Party because they want to stop crime they want to stop people from pouring into our country from places unknown and from countries unknown from countries that nobody ever heard of that's where the enthusiasm yeah I don't know I don't know if I can or not I got him elected without me he wouldn't be Governor I got him elected uh he was doing terribly I got him elected with that being said I hope we can repair it but if we don't the people are still the people and they're going to vote we're leading in Georgia by a lot we're leading in Pennsylvania by a lot so but I don't know now in Pennsylvania I have great relationships in Georgia I do too but unfortunately not with the government I've never understood it when you get somebody elected they're supposed to like you he's not exactly uh for some reason and you'll have to ask him about that yeah I'd love to see it get repaired I think that if we don't win Georgia Georgia is a big is a big win is a big state so I won Alabama by a record nobody's ever gotten that many votes I won South Carolina by a record you don't win Alabama and South Carolina by records and lose Georgia it doesn't happen and the people of Georgia understand that there was tremendous uh anxiety and problems in Georgia a lot of people say what happened and uh we have to all we want is honest elections if we have honest elections in Georgia and we have honest elections in Pennsyvania we're going to win them by a lot well he actually said it two ways first he said it incorrectly then he corrected himself do you agree with that right you know if you watch him he said it two ways no no no I mean he said it two ways because he doesn't really know what he's saying why didn't he bring it up at the debate you know he had a chance for 90 minutes to bring it up at the debate he could have talked about that at the debate and he didn't do it everyone said oh he said this and he said that he's just you know they give him something to read off he read it very badly because he actually said it the opposite then he had to go back and correct himself he said the opposite he should have brought this up at the debate if he had a problem of course there'll be a peaceful transfer and there was last time and there'll be a peaceful transfer I just hope we're going to have honest elections that's all okay what a stupid question this is uh because I'm leading by a lot and because I'm letting their convention go through uh and I am compaining a lot I'm doing tremendous amounts of of taping here we have commercials that are at a level I don't think that anybody's ever done before Plus in certain cases I see many of you in the room where I'm speaking to you on phones I'm speaking to radio I'm speaking to television television's coming over here excuse me what are we doing right now she's not doing any news conference you know why she's not doing because she can't do a news conference she doesn't know how to do a news conference she's not smart enough to do a news conference and I'm sorry we need smart people to leave this country because our country's never been in this danger before both economically and from an outside from an outside perspective Russia doesn't respect us anymore China doesn't respect us anymore North Korea Kim Jong-un liked me a lot he doesn't like this group we we are in great danger we're great danger of being in World War II that could happen no after their convention yeah and I'm going out actually I'm going out to certain places to help certain senators get elected not even for me I'm trying to help when I go go out to Wyoming or when I go out to Montana or I'm going to different places to help people and I don't have to go there because I'm leading those States as you know by 35 40 50 points I'm leading by record numbers I'm going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected congressmen and women get elected yes please yeah go ahead the up upcoming what oh yeah yeah the Elon Musk so yeah sure so Elon called me as you know he endorsed me full-throated great endorsement I respect Elon a lot he respects me and not easy for him to endorse to be honest with you you know it takes courage to endorse uh people uh many people have courage and many people don't he does have courage and Elon endorsed me and he asked me whether or not I'd do a show on Monday and I think it's going to be Monday night and I believe he's the host of the show so it'll be very interesting a lot of people are talking about it I look forward to it that'll be done on Monday night well you have a lot of misinformation spread about China and you have a lot of misinformation spread about a lot of different places I think I'm going to get along great with China uh president she of China and I were very good friends we met right here right in that except we had a beautiful sofa there as opposed to what we have right now right now we have you but president she uh and I had a very good relationship until Co and I held him responsible for Co it broke up our relationship but I think we're going to have a great relationship and I think it's going to be mutually beneficial but we cannot have it where China is taking advantage of the United States and that's what they were doing as you very well know yes please what what's your question no I think the people that if you look at January 6 which a lot of people aren't talking about very much I think those people were treated very harshly when you compare them to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed nobody was killed on January 6 but I think that uh the people of January 6th were treated very unfairly and they were they were there to complain not through me they were there to complain about an election and you know it's very interesting the too and I said peacefully and patriotically which nobody wants to say but I said peacefully and patriotically the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to and you've seen Maggie I was in at the mall I was at the Washington Monument I was at the whole thing I had crowds I don't know who's ever had a bigger crowd than I have but I had it many times the biggest crowd I've ever spoken before was that day and I'll tell you um it's very hard to find a picture of that crowd you see the picture of a small number of people relatively going to the capital but you never see the picture of the crowd the biggest crowd I've ever spoken I've spoken to the biggest crowds nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me if you look at Martin Luther King when he uh did his speech his great speech and you look at ours same real estate same everything same number of people if not we had more and they said he had a million people but I had 25,000 people but when you look at the exact same picture and everything's the same because it was The Fountains the whole thing all the way back to uh from Lincoln to Washington and you look at it and you look at the picture of his crowd my crowd uh we actually had more people they said I had 25,000 and he had a million people and I'm okay with it because I liked Dr Martin Luther King yeah please yeah sure we have a constitution it's a very important document and we live by it she has no votes and I'm very happy to run against her I'm not complaining from that standpoint and I hate to be defending him but he did not want to leave he wanted to see if he could win they said you're not going to win after the debate they said you're not going to win you can't win you're out and at first they said it nicely and he wasn't leaving and then you you know that you know it better than anybody wait a minute so uh when you think about it they said at first they were going to go out to another vote they were going to go through a primary system a quick primary system which it would have to be and then it all disappeared and they just picked a person that was the first out she was the first loser okay so we call her the first loser she was the first loser when uh during the primary system during the Democrat primary system she was the first one to quit and she quit she had no votes no support and she was a bad debater by the way very bad debater and that's not the thing I'm looking forward to but she was a bad debater she did obviously a bad job she never made it to Iowa then for some reason and I know he regrets it you do too he picked her and she turned on him too she was working with the people that wanted him out but the fact that you can be get no votes lose in the primary system in other words you had 14 or 15 people she was the first one out and that you can then be picked to run for a president it seems seems to me actually unconstitutional perhaps it's not please so I've run against Hillary and uh I've run against various other people uh I would say that in terms of intelligence Hillary was far Superior I would say that Hillary was smart she was Her Own Worst Enemy in many ways but she was smart very smart okay if you ask me to compare them please uh would you repeat that question please do you have to speak up yes sir it's a hard room because it's very big if you know so this is worth $18 million oh I say yeah so I think the abortion issue is written very much tampered down and I've answered I think very well in the debate and it seems to be much less of an issue especially for those where they have the exceptions as you know and uh I think it's when I look for 52 years they wanted to bring abortion back to the States they wanted to get rid of Ro Wade and that's Democrats Republicans and independents and everybody liberals conservatives everybody wanted it back in the States and I did that now the states are voting and frankly some of the votes are much more if you could say liberal than you would think Ohio turned out to be they had a big vote and it turned out to be a much more liberal standing than people would have thought uh Kansas the same thing and then you have Texas and you have other places where it may be different but the issue has been brought back to the States now and like Ronald Reagan I believe in the exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother uh I believe you know I believe strongly I think that uh that's a very important thing I think when you don't you have to follow your heart but when you don't believe and the exceptions I think it's much tougher it's a much tougher issue but about 82% of Republicans do believe in exceptions I think the uh and a lot of them are changing their mind and coming even even further I think that abortion has become much less of an issue it's a very I think it's actually going to be a very small issue what I've done is I've done what every Democrat and every every Republican wanted to have done and we brought that issue back to the States and now the states are uh voting on it and frankly uh some of the votes are a lot different than people would have thought but it's the vote of the people that's taking care of it and you know when you think about the radical the Democrats are really the radical ones on this because they're allowed to do abort abortion on the eth and nth month and even after birth if you look at your new uh Governor from Minnesota he's talking about he's like the governor previous the former Governor and I don't want to get him mixed up because Glenn is doing a good job and he's leading our he's leading our whole campaign in Virginia Glenn yunan but previous Glenn the governor he said the baby will be born we will put the baby aside and we will decide with the mother what we're going to do in other words whether or not we're going to kill the baby the Minnesota gentleman he this guy agrees with that he is the most liberal look between her and him there's never been anything anything like this there's never been a combination so I'll use the word Progressive you know they want to go progress they don't like the word liberal I like liberal better I think it's more appropriate because nobody knows what Progressive means but they now like to use the word Progressive but there's certainly never been anybody so liberal like these two or even CL I think the abortion issue has been uh taken down many notches I don't think it's of uh I don't think it's a big factor anymore really and when people hear what what I said in the debate and I think I said it very well during the debate we've brought it back to the States everybody wanted it in the states and very importantly and and you think about this uh assuming you have exceptions if you don't have exceptions it's a more difficult thing at the same time there are people that strongly feel that way and you have to follow your heart and you should follow your heart but that issue has is very much subdued yeah thank you about who yes no I didn't uh look if you take away a gun she wants to take away everyone's gun if you take away guns can't do it because people need the guns for protection now entertainment they wanted hunting they would you know different things but they need weapons for protection in this country people live out in the woods and they're not going to have a gun if you look at some some countries I don't want to go I don't want to get them in trouble but some countries have actually gone the opposite way they had very strong gun laws and now they have gone the opposite way where they allowed people to have guns where in one case they encouraged people to go out and get guns and crime is down 29% and remember this what is the toughest gun law in the United States Chicago on July 4th 117 people were shot and 17 died the toughest gun laws in the United States are in the city of Chicago you know that they had 117 people shot Afghanistan does not have that Afghanistan by the way was the lowest point in the history of our country in my opinion that was the worst embarrassment to the history of this country and I say Putin would not have gone into Ukraine if that didn't happen when he saw the incompetence of Millie and all these guys that are incompetent when he saw that happen when they took out the soldiers first they took out the soldiers first you know if you go back and check your records uh for 18 months I had a talk with Abdul Abdul was the leader of the Taliban still is but I had a strong talk with him for 18 months not one American Soldier was shot at or killed but not even shot at 18 months and then we had the disaster of the of the lift where people were falling off airanes from three times the height of the World Trade Center I mean terrible but uh now our country has to be respected again please go ahead please I'd be against that that Kamala is in favor of not giving Israel weapons yeah that's what I hear look uh she's been very very bad to Israel and she's been very bad to Jewish people and I say it if anybody I know is Jewish and they would vote for Kamala over me they should have their head examined if you think about it I gave them Golan Heights I gave them the capital of Israel Jerusalem I built the I even built the embassy I gave them no Iran deal the problem is they didn't do anything with it Iran was broke with we could have made a deal so easily I would have had a deal done within one week after the election with Iran Iran can't have a nuclear weapon it's very simple we would have gotten along with Iran I was looking forward to it I I was fine with Iran you know we hit them a couple of times pretty hard but we would have been fine with Iran but I got them I terminated that deal I got them the Abraham Accords everyone said that's impossible I got them the Abraham records she's been very very bad to Israel and she's been very bad and disrespectful to Jewish people and any Jewish person that votes for Kamala and her friend her new friend who I don't know if she knew him before but I don't think he's too good but anybody that votes for them if you're Jewish or if you love Israel you have to have your head examined go ahead please they have the FBI came to see me about the shooter uh I think they've done a very good job and I think they did a very good job with respect to this other lunatic that they have in custody please yeah well I know Willie Brown very well in fact I went down in a helicopter with him we thought maybe this is the end we were in a helicopter going to a certain location together and there was an emergency landing this was not a pleasant landing and Willie was he was a little concerned so I know him I know him pretty well I mean I haven't seen him in years uh but he told me terrible things about her but this is what you're telling me anyway I guess but he he had a big part in what happened with Kamala but he he I don't know maybe he's changed his tune but he uh he was not a fan of hers very much at that point yeah I do go ahead on what uh well I'm going to announce that I'm going to actually have a press conference on that at some point in the near future so I don't want to tell you now but uh Florida does have a vote coming up on that and I think probably the vote will go in a little more liberal way than people thought but I'll be announcing that at the appropriate time please yeah oh we gave tremendous and tremendous for child care and all of that no our tax our tax uh cuts which are the biggest in history our tax cuts are coming due as you know very soon and if the Democrats don't renew them or make it impossible to renew because it's pretty close uh in terms of vote if they don't renew them uh it's the equivalent of having a four times tax increase from what you have right now and it'll destroy the economy I think they're under tremendous pressure to do it I've never seen you know all my life I grow up and I watch politics and I used to be on the other side of politics very certain then I run for office but in all the years of studying politics I've never seen people get elected by saying we're going to give you a tax increase these guys get up think of it we're going to give you no security we're going to give you a weak military we're going to give you no walls no borders no anything we're going all these things they're doing I mean transgender the transgender became such a big thing but they do all of these things but they always say we're going to give you a tax increase I never heard anybody campaign on a tax increase a politician has always said I will cut tax taxes I'll give you one example uh Social Security they're going to destroy Social Security uh I am going to leave Social Security I'm not raising the years I'm not raising the age uh I will be saving Social Security and I'm going to work it out that there's no tax on social security for seniors I'm also doing no tax on tips no tax on tips so waiters waitresses caddies people that drive cars people that get tips who have been harassed by this government we're going to have no tax on tips that's a big thing uh yeah oh absolutely sure because other people have done far bigger things than Steve Bannon sure it's politically motivated I think it's a horrible thing they did look they've weaponized government against me look at the Florida case it was a totally weaponized case all of these cases by the way the New York cases are totally controlled out of the Department of Justice they sent their top person to the various places they went to the AG's office got that one going then he went to the DA's office got that one going ran through it no no this is all politics and it's a disgrace never happened in this country it's it's very common that it happens but not in our country it happens in banana republics and third world countries and that's what we're becoming we have no bord we have bad voting regulations anytime you have mailin ballots you're going to have problems France learned that lesson you know France had all mailin voting and they went back to paper ballots uh voter identification voter ID they went back to a normal system one day voting they don't want to be around you know voting for 64 days and look the election I keep talking about November 5th but the election really starts on September 6th that's when it starts because it's early voting we should have one day voting we should have paper ballots we should have voter ID and we should have proof of citizenship please no the gentleman are back for who you're gonna have to talk louder sir Elon um is a different kind of a guy uh he's a very big believer in the country but he's very worried about the country he's very worried about the country and I don't know if it's good for him politically to have supported me although I think we have a vast majority of this country does support me uh but Elon more than almost anybody I know I mean he he loves this country he loves the concept of the country but like me he says this country is in big trouble it's in big it's in tremendous danger okay please I like I like this guy I like him yeah the polls have suggested there are some polls that say we're going to win in a landslide people are voting with their stomachs meaning they going to the grocery store they're paying 50 60 70% more for food than they did just a couple of years ago look at what's happened to energy look at what's happened not only to their cars where gasoline's gone from 187 a187 and we we had moments when it was below that but it's gone from a187 to $56 and7 and they take the Strategic National reserves and they take it out even though it's peanuts compared it doesn't last long but they they're virtually empty now we've never had it this low and he's using that to keep the gas prices as low as possible he's sucked all of the oil out essentially the gasoline to keep the to keep the price down a little bit and it's had very little impact but you know what we have no strategic National reserves now he's emptied it it's almost empty it's never been this low and I had it at a good level and I would have had it more if the Democrats would have approved the deal you know I had a deal to buy it at $22 a barrel and now it's getting it's going to be close to a 100 pretty soon my opinion and the Democrats didn't want to do that but we bought a lot anyway and we had it pretty good and what they've done to the National reserves the Strategic National reserves is as you know very well because you cover it but what they've done is incredible they've they've just for the sake of getting some votes for the sake of having gasoline you know that's meant for Wars It's meant for like tragedy it's not meant to keep against price down so that somebody can vote for Biden or in this case Cala who by the way is worse than Biden and she's actually not as smart okay she's actually not as smart that's hard to believe isn't it yeah please okay so you could you could do things that will be would would supplement absolutely and those things are pretty uh open and uh Humane but you have to be able to have a vote and all I want to do is give everybody a vote and the votes are taking place right now as we speak yeah but it's a very there are many things on a Humane bases that you can do outside of that but you also have to give a vote and the people are going to have to decide okay yes please you on what no I think she's actually not as smart as he is I don't think he's very smart either by the way I'm not a big fan of his brain but I think that she's actually not as smart as he is well uh she's a woman she represents certain groups of people but I I will say this when people find out about her I think she'll be much less I and I see it right now I see her going way down to the polls now now that people are finding out that she destroyed San Francisco she destroyed the state of California along with Governor Gavin nusum he's been a terrible Governor terrible but they did it together and she was early I mean she was the first of the prosecutors really you know now you see Philadelphia you see Los Angeles you see New York you see various people that are very bad but she was the first of the bad prosecutors she was early who would you repeat that please no you would you repeat her what you said you have to speak up this room is very louder do you hear her a Daily Press briefing why would I do that I would give you all the Press briefings you want look what I'm doing here but why would I do a daily a daily press you get tired of me very fast no but I I will give you Total Access and you'll have a lot of press briefings and you'll have uh from me now are you talking about from me or from a press secretary well yeah probably they'll do something if it's not daily it's going to be a lot you'll have more than you want yeah please uh I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk about it I think it's a tragic story you want to know the truth and I felt that with Hillary Clinton too you know with Hillary Clinton I could have done things to her that would have made your head spin I thought it was a very bad thing take the wife of a president of the United States and put her in jail and then I see the way they treat me that's the way it goes but uh I was very protective of her nobody would understand that but I was I think my people understand it they used to say lock her up lock her up and I'd say just relax please we won the election I think it would be very I I think it would have been horrible for our country if I and we had her between uh the hammering of all of the files and don't forget she got a subpoena from the United States Congress and then after getting the subpoena she destroyed everything that she was supposed to get I could I didn't think I thought it was so bad to take her and put her in jail the wife of a president of the United States and then when it's my turn nobody thinks that way I thought it was a very terrible thing and she did a lot of very bad things I'll tell you what she was she was pretty evil but in terms of the country and in terms of unifying the country bringing it back to have taken her and to have put her in jail and I think you know the things as well as I do there were some pretty bad acts that she did uh I think it would have been very bad for our country and a lot of my people a lot of the maga as they call but the base and I think the Bas is I think the base is 75% of the country far beyond the Republican party because we're a party of Common Sense and I'm a person of common sense I want to have low taxes I want to have strong borders I want to have a strong military so that China and Russia look they've allowed China and Russia to do the impossible combined they're natural enemies they always have been because China needs more land and Russia has it they've always been natural enemies and because of Obama it started with him and then Biden because he didn't know what the hell he was doing they've now become one force and then now they're adding Iran to it and they're adding North Korea to it pretty powerful force this is something that is Unthinkable that they allowed to happen oh it's going to end the honeymoon period's going to end look she's got a little period she's got a convention coming up it's about policy it's not about her I think she's incompetent because I've watched her she destroyed California she destroyed San Franc everything she's touched has turned to bad things I want to use I'm not going to use foul language but everything she's touched has turned bad she's incompetent the reason she's not doing what I do and she's not doing what she should be doing she won't even do interviews with friendly people because she can't do better than Biden now he had a reason for not doing well and he was never 25 years ago the sharpest or Brightest Bulb in the ceiling that I can tell you okay he wasn't but he could do interviews at least not lately he couldn't perhaps but she's she should be doing interviews she doesn't want to do interviews and the reason she doesn't is number one her policies is so bad just to answer your question I think that it's not going to change because it's really ultimately not about her as much as about her policies she wants open borders she wants to defund the police she wants to defund the police she wants to take away your guns anybody that thinks they're not going to come after your guns you know when I was President I totally protected the guns and I think it's very important and I know I take some heat sometimes for it but you have to have safety you have to have when the bad guy walks in with a gun you got to have some way of protecting yourself and boy that would be you would see crime go up at levels that you've never seen when people say on the side of the house this house has guns we will use the guns they say let's pass we'll go someplace else you have to have them uh and for four years and you know as you know the NRA endorsed me very powerfully every time I ran every time my sons are uh members and I guess indirectly I'm a member too but they gave me the strongest of endorsements and that's against very strong competition people that you know felt the same way no you have to have uh you have to have that right our Second Amendment is a very important right and it has to be protected okay how about you go ahead yeah so there are some of the most brilliant people on Wall Street that are saying that uh um if president Trump doesn't win you're going to have a depression I happen to agree I think that's true because I know how bad these people are you know they like to say that they did this and that you saw the S trillion that they said it was me for 7 trillion it wasn't me it was them they said that I had inflation they took over 9% infl no no I had 1% inflation I had actually no inflation because if you look at the categories we had just about no inflation but I had a very minor I I actually had a positive inflation it was a perfect number because you don't want zero I mean I'm not going to give you a whole course on economics but you don't want zero 1% 1.4% is great you want a little bit because you don't want to have deflation deflation is in many ways even worse I had a perfect number right around the 1% number it was perfect and to show you it stayed there for 2 years and then he did all of the different borrowings that he did and then he did so many things wrong every time he would do it I'd say big mistake and don't forget they sell hats and they sell stories Trump was right about everything I have been right about a lot yes Maggie well we had a commission like other people do and it's always complicated and it's always controversial and we had commissions that and I think of respected people you know many of the people on the commission and they would recommend to me uh certain pardons for certain people some people were treated very harshly uh a fantastic woman as you know she served 24 years for being on a phone call having to do with drugs you know who I'm talking about she was great and she had another 24 years to go and it was lodging about marijuana which in many cases is now legalized okay but but we had but we had uh many very highly regarded people on a commission and they'd recommend and they'd put a reason why uh some people were you know served time but they served a lot of time for something that today people wouldn't even serve time by well for the most part I think they did I mean they did they go through they they went through I had a commission who was a very important mission to me and highly respected people and frankly they came up with some decisions that I wouldn't necessarily agree with but I did it but I let a lot of people out that were that had no representation I went to people in jails in prison that we respected I said how many of these people should be let out we let out large groups of lowincome people that were serving like 40 years for something that today you wouldn't even be put in jail for we had very few people uh let out cuz I said I really don't want to let people out where they had a lot of violence where they had killing etc etc and for the most part we didn't do that yeah please on defense ah Federal Reserve right well look the Federal Reserve is a very interesting thing and it's sort of gotten it wrong a lot and uh he's tending to be a little bit lateer on things he gets a little bit too early and a little bit too late and you know that's very largely a uh it's a gut feeling I believe it's really a gut feeling and I used to have it out with him I had it out with him a couple of times very strongly I I fought him very hard and uh you know we get along fine we get along long fine but I I feel that I feel a president should have at least say in there yeah I feel that strongly I think that uh in my case I made a lot of money I was very successful and I think I have a better Instinct than in many cases people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman yeah yeah well as we Legalize It I start to agree a lot more because you know you're being it's being illegalized all over the country Florida has something coming up I'll be making a statement about that fairly soon but as we legalize it throughout the country whether that's a good thing or a bad thing it's awfully hard to have people all over the jails that are in jail right now for something that's legal so uh I think obviously there's a lot of sentiment to doing that yeah please well you'll have to ask her that question because she's the one that said it uh I didn't say it so you'll have to ask her and I very much appreciate that question but you'll have to ask her but I've known her for a long time I actually contributed to her campaign a long time ago because I was a developer I contributed to lots of campaigns of Democrats Republicans and some were liberal and some were conservative uh but you'll have to ask her about that but uh to me it doesn't matter but to her from her standpoint I think it's very disrespectful to both really whether it's Indian or black I think it's very disrespectful to both to me it doesn't matter uh please red dress red dress yeah pretty uh pretty much recovered yeah I'm a fast healer it's a hell of a shot but I'm a fast healer yeah pretty much pretty much recovered do you have any no it didn't hit that I got very lucky it it just it just hit the the lobe as they call it yeah a little bit not much on top a little bit yeah well we're starting that yeah what are you really talking we are going to start the largest mass deportation in the history of our country because we have no choice it's not sustainable and we are going to start with violent criminals and we're going to start then with criminals and our local police is going to work with us because they know everything about the people they know their names they know everything about them they know their middle name they know their numbers and as you know the other side is trying you know look for years I wondered why are they allowing these people to come minute levels like this it was incredible and I said two reasons they're either really stupid and I don't believe they're stupid because anybody that can cheat on elections like they cheat is not stupid or in the alternative they have bad motives or they hate our country and I used to think they hate our country but lately I've seen where they're trying to sign these people up to vote and they have to stop they cannot let illegal immigrants vote in this upcoming election I one more question uh uh go ahead one more make it a good one please right we have so many ways of making money in this country we're not going to affect our social security we're not changing it and I proved that over four years and we're going to do it it's very unfair to people very they they spend their life and they're great citizens and they pay in when not not going to charge tax to our to Social Security the seniors we're not going to do it we're not going to charge and also tax I say the two things we're going to have no tax on seniors Social Security and we're going to have no tax on tips very simple and we are a country that has so many different ways to make money we have we have under our feet more Liquid Gold I call it oil and gas than any country in the world much more than Saudi Arabia much more than Russia we have so many different ways we can make money we're not going to hurt our seniors with Social Security and we're not going to charge them tax okay we should not have Sanctuary cities Sanctuary cities is a way of protecting criminals and we should not have Sanctuary cities and if you go to California and I know it well I have property out there great property if you go to California and you ask the people of California do they like the idea of sanctuary cities they don't like it they're tired of it they're tired of crime they're tired of what's happened to our country our country has become a crime ridden mess and we're going to stop it on November 5th thank you very much everybody thank you thank you",Mar a Lago,2024/8/8,
6,Donald Trump, thank you thank you very much everybody we have to save our country God bless you all God bless you all  and I never thought anything like this could happen in America never thought it could happen the only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it from the beginning the Democrats abide in my campaign remember that they attacked me with an onslaught of fraudulent investigations Russia Russia Russian Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine and peachman hoax number one impeachment hoax number two the illegal and unconstitutional raid on Mar-A-Lago right here the line to the fisa courts the FBI and doj relentlessly pursuing Republicans the unconstitutional changes to election laws by not getting approvals from state legislators the millions of votes illegally stuffed into ballot boxes and all caught on government cameras and just recently the FBI and doj in collusion with Twitter and Facebook in order not to say anything bad about the hunter Biden laptop from him which exposes dividing family as criminals in which according to the pollsters would have made a 17 point difference in the election result and we needed a lot less than that like about 16.9 it would have been in our favor not my favorite our favorite because our country is going to hell and we remember the 51 intelligence agents who said Hunter Biden's laptop was rushing disinformation didn't exist it was Russian disinformation remember that and that was all confirmed strongly by the FBI when they all knew that it wasn't Russian disinformation and so much more our elections were like those of a third world country and now this massive election interference at his scale never seen before in our country beginning with the radical left George Soros back prosecutor Alvin Bragg of New York who campaigned on the fact that he would get president Trump I'm going to get him I'm going to get him this is you want to get president Trump at any cost and this before he knew anything about me didn't know a thing about me who's campaigning as it turns out virtually everybody that has looked at this case including rhinos and even hardcore Democrats say there is no crime and that it should never have been brought  even people that aren't big fans it's an insult to our country as the world is already laughing at us for so many other reasons like our open borders are incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan Where We Left Behind American citizens 85 billion dollars worth of the best military equipment in the world lost 13 magnificent young lives and far too many to mention that are so badly hurt with the loss of arms and legs and facial obliteration the most embarrassing time in our country's history in my opinion then our give up on energy Independence and even energy dominant we're going to be dominant within six months more than any other Nation times two we had this all just three years ago our raging crime statistics if you look in democrat-run cities numbers the likes of which we have never seen before the open threats by various countries of the use of nuclear weapons something never mentioned or discussed by outside Nations during the Trump Administration in which could very well lead under the Biden administration's leadership to an all-out nuclear World War III can happen away from it believe it or not an economy that has been crippled by the biggest inflation we have seen in more than 60 years and a military that I use to defeat Isis in four weeks he said it would take four years four weeks to kill al-baghdadi in solomoni that has now gone woke at the top Levels by trying to indoctrinate everyone down to the lowest ranking Patriot but now they have really stepped up their reference by indicting the 45th president of the United States who received  75 million votes which is more than any sitting president in the history of our country  and in the wings they've got a local racist Democrat district attorney in Atlanta who is doing everything in her to indict me over an absolutely perfect phone call even more perfect than the one I made with the president of Ukraine remember a kid kept saying that's a perfect call this one was more perfect nobody said sir you shouldn't say that many people over the phone or hug up and discuss because of something I inappropriately say because nothing was said wrong in fact at the end of the call we agreed to continue our conversation about election fraud an election fraud specifically in Georgia at a later time many people on the phone including lots of lawyers nobody found anything wrong with that perfect call until a book promotion to her many months later all of a sudden they said you know I remember making a call let's look at that this fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election and it should be dropped immediately  then you have a radical left lunatic known as a bomb thrower who is harassing hundreds of my people day after day over the boxes hoax you know the box is hooked as we call it just so everyone knows I come under what's known as the presidential records act which was designed and approved by Congress long ago just for this reason under the ACT I'm supposed to negotiate with Nara the National Archives and Records Administration which as of this date is a radical left trouble making organization that red flags the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights is dangerous and triggering can you imagine this is what we have to deal with but there is no criminality under the presidential records Act that is not what it's all about we were negotiating in very good faith proper way in order to return some or all of the documents that I openly and in very plain sight brought with me to Mar-A-Lago from our beautiful white house just as virtually every other president has done in the past when FBI and doj officials would narrow with here I told my lawyer to show them the first Secure Storage Room in which they were locked the FBI cell request in writing was could you please put another lock on the door we immediately comply it's a lot different than the biting situation isn't it the next thing I know we were rated by many gun toning FBI agents who took whatever they wanted including my passports and medical records everybody was in shock nobody had ever heard of such a raid before can't even believe it who would think that that could happen today I immediately thought of the fourth amendment that protects against unreasonable but they did it anyway because our justice system has become Lawless they're using it now in addition to everything else to win elections apparently they're not looking at me through the view of the non-criminal presidential records act they came up with a new one this is a new one and they're looking at me through the Espionage Act how does that sound of 1917 where the penalty is death even though there is absolutely nothing to do with openly taking boxes of documents and mostly clothing and other things to my home which President Obama has done the bushes of time Jimmy Carter has done Ronald Reagan has done everybody's done in fact Hillary Clinton got rid of 33 000 emails and that was okay but nobody's done it like Joe Biden this lunatic special prosecutor named Jack Smith I wonder what it was prior to a change who others of his ilk say he is even worse than they are is only looking at Trump yet Joe Biden took massive amounts more documents even removed many boxes to Chinatown you believe that he's got 10 million dollars from China where did that come from I guess they were banking on Hunter's expertise and had others stored in unsecured offices in Pennsylvania and screwed all over his garage floor where his now very famous Corvette is also stored all over the floor including classified documents but that's okay perhaps most importantly he has 1850 boxes in Delaware which he is refusing to give up but isn't that real obstruction it's obstruction as president I have the right to declassify documents and the process is automatic if I take them with me it's automatic Declassified Biden was vice president he had absolutely no right to be classified as vice president he doesn't come under the non-criminal presidential records act he comes under the very criminal Federal records act unfortunately for him but it's not going to matter because they don't follow the law which has very severe penalties he had classified documents that he took while he was a senator which is absolutely inexcusable and other Senators including Democrats are outraged but he's not being arrested and hounded like the people who work for Leon in fact they seem to have forgotten about his documents entirely so many thousands and thousands okay with him they like to say that I'm obstructing which I'm not because I was working with Nara very nicely until the raid on my home but Biden is obstructing by making it impossible to get the 1800 and 50 boxes or explain why many documents were located in Chinatown can't explain it why were they Enchanted that I don't know lastly I'm under investigation this time of civil investigation by another racist in reverse to also campaigned on I will get Trump I will get them this was your campaign never ran for office I will get him her name is Leticia James  as he proclaimed while campaigning quote I look forward to going into the Office of the Attorney General every single day suing him and then going home for sure she announced what is purely my soul right now is Trump and that she had her eyes on Trump Tower those eyes are focused didn't know the young lady he even assured her supporters in an election promise that we're going to definitely sue him we're going to be a real pain in the ass he's going to know my name personally and then she claimed that I was an illegitimate president with all we did with all we did on energy with all we did on the military or taxes biggest tax cuts in history biggest regulation Cuts in history right to try people able to get drugs now that aren't improved  Leticia James vowed to use every area of the law to quote investigate president Trump and his business transactions those transactions are going to be investigated she said and that of her family and his family because we're going after his family and we're going after them hard this is all before entering office and all before knowing anything at all about me but you're gonna get me this is why along with unrelenting crime so many people and companies are leaving New York she said that I falsified my financial statements but in fact we're proving and we'll prove that my financial statements were substantially more than we submitted not less and in all cases have a strong disclaimer clause in them which tells the institutions that may look at that if they want to not to rely on the statement but they've got a problem with their case because number one I'm very under leverage they can't believe it all the stuff they read and gave and have very little debt relative to the value of assets and importantly not One bank has lost even one dollar she was investigating but they didn't lose a dollar with us during this period of time in fact the banks we're talking about made almost 200 million dollars off Donald Trump and they liked me very much we never missed a payment never got a default notice had a great relationship with all of them I don't need Banks I have a lot of cash I built a great business with my family built a fantastic person  I have a son here who's done a great job and I have another son here he's done a great job  smart but I have a great family and they've done a fantastic job and we appreciate it very much  so she's suing me over banks that weren't defrauded you should be focused on violent crime that's driving people out of things this is a persecution not an investigation she's put our family through hell it's cost hundreds of millions of dollars to defend but our heads are held very very high they want to settled the case but I want no part of that so here we are now for today in a city that was so gracious four or five years ago but now we're there spend time there today as you possibly will the local failed district attorney charging a former president of the United States for the first time in history on a basis that every single pundit and legal owner said there is no case there's no case they kept saying there's no case virtually everyone but it's far worse than that because he knew there was no case that's why last week he delayed for a month and then immediately took that back and through this ridiculous indictment together came out today everybody said this is not really an indictment there's nothing here my lawyers came to me and they said there's nothing here they're not even saying what you did the criminal is the district attorney because he illegally leaked massive amounts of grand jury  for which he should be prosecuted or at a minimum he should resign and Alvin Bragg's wife confirmed a report that claimed her husband has Trump nailed on felonies she has since locked down her Twitter account his chief prosecutor who represented the Democrats and crooked Hillary Clinton and a firm run by Chuck Schumer's brother Robert he quit the firm in order to go to work in the D.A office in order to get drunk can you imagine that Hillary Clinton's lawyer Democrat lawyer Democrat firm ultimately he quit as Chief prosecutor because Bragg didn't think he had a case the same guy that brought this yeah during his investigation this prosecuted in mark pomeritz wrote and published a book saying all sorts of privileged things has been very strongly reprimanded he was reprimanded so strongly I've never seen anything like it at probably the end of it but what he did was probably very illegal but he was very very strongly reprimanded even district attorney Bragg was furious with him they were having a tremendous fight in the office because of but hope is never lost because various prosecutors and bda's office also quit because they thought president Trump was being treated very unfairly how about that isn't that great oh I love them I'd like to meet them I'd like to meet the DA's office even had a web page meet the team of Executives who have done this to president Trump that was the title isn't that nice they immediately had to take it down meanwhile overall crime in New York was up 30 percent last year much more than that the year before with felony assaults robberies and burglaries all up by massive massive numbers not the same place that I know not the same place that human and this is where we are right now I have a trump-hating judge with the trump-hating wife and family whose daughter worked for Kamala Harris and now receives money from the Biden Harris campaign and a lot of men we recently had another trial and the same judge told the fine man who worked for me for many many years that if you admit your guilt you will be in jail for 90 days but if you don't if we go through a trial and you're found guilty you're going away for 10 years and maybe longer which for a 75 year old man with a great family really means life what the prosecutors and judge did to that man I will never forget because it's right out of the old Soviet Union that's where we are they said you say anything about Trump meaning that's bad and you won't even have to serve the 90 days you'll walk free and they say that to many of my employees we have this Jack Smith lunatic threatening people every single day through his Representatives they're threatening jail terms but talk about Trump and you'll go free this is they can't beat us through the law that's the country in which we live however right now the USA is a mess our economy is crashing inflation is out of control Russia has joined with China can you believe that Saudi Arabia has joined with Iran China Russia Iran and North Korea have formed together is a menacing and destructive Coalition would have never happened if I were your president would never have happened nor would Russia attacking Ukraine have happened and all of those lives would be saved to all of those beautiful cities would be standing our currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world standing which will be our greatest defeat frankly in 200 years there will be no defeat like that that will take us away from being even a great power if you took the five worst Presidents in the history of the United States and added them up they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden Administration have been  incredibly we are now a failing Nation we are a nation in Decline and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere with our elections by using law enforcement we can't let that happen  with all of this being said and with a very dark cloud over our Beloved Country I have no doubt nevertheless that we will make America great again God bless you and God bless America thank you very much thank you   foreign

7,Donald Trump,what do you want me to say jennifer okay can i use your back i love this this is fun using jennifer's back to sign a release i could do this all day long thank you john howard always howard i just like howard from day one i've liked howard he's a good man how are you i'm very good thank you well it's a horror i mean the war is a total disaster it seems to me to be almost worse than to like the bush vietnam on taxation i really believe in them and i i not just because you pay less the fact is you have more incentive to do things and i think it's good it puts people to work but the war is a total catastrophe and if anything brings them down that’s going to bring them down that and perhaps you and the fcc your intern is very pretty well she is terrific in bed now she wouldn't want me to say that but she she's just overall terrific i think most important well sometime early next year no we haven't set a date  i don't have the courage to play  we're going to have a prenup you have to have a written too many books robin about prenups not to have one i said no i have men that are destroyed i have friends that are very smart killer people that people are afraid to even deal with them and yet a wife five foot two a hundred pounds destroys them I’ve seen that many wives well it's a very tough thing actually you know doing business deals is sort of natural and easy as far as i'm concerned doing prenups is a whole different deal you're in love with someone you go up to her you tell her how in love you are you know in the case melania i love you very much you're the most beautiful woman i've ever seen and we're going to be together forever but just in case it doesn't work out right would you please immediately sign this so it's it's not a it's you know it's an unattractive instrument i'm not going to get into the nitty-gritty d you have to have a lawyer if she doesn't have a lawyer which of course is a disaster because all of a sudden she'll show up with this killer but if she doesn't have a lawyer you know it doesn't hold up  i'll give them whatever they want right  well it's two ways you know there are women that won't sign prenup and they have good intentions and there are women that won't sign prenups and they have bad intentions now i know a woman who's totally in love with a guy she refuses to sign she said our marriage is more than that i honestly don't believe she's trying to rip him off she just feels that it's a horrible thing i don't think my life my father many many years ago he was 93 when he passed away many years ago hhad a 63-year marriage to a wonderful woman named my mother right okay yes and i heard that he has to for prenup can you believe this this is like you know  70 years ago yeah the guy was well he was great he was ahead of his time and he asked her for a prenup and she threw him out of the house she said actually didn't even throw him out of the house because they didn't live together for those days in those days you get married and then you move in together but she he actually asked her for a prenup and she would say she had good intentions i haven't actually begun that negotiation she I have a friend who's a total brutal killer okay he just kills everyone he's a very rich guy and he's had a couple of horrible marriages so now he meets a new woman and he tells me donald this is the one now his last one ripped them off for about 50. 50 million i mean you know she was married to him for two years she made him dinner every once in a while right yeah so now he calls me he said donald i've met the one of course he's told me this now four times yeah so i said you're gonna get a prenup right he said done honestly i don't need it here's a guy who's a genius businessman but he's a stuck he’s a smuck he married her two years ago and about a week and a half ago he told me i said how's she doing that son of a bitch okay guy probably  it's over already so i said by the way tell me yes tell me you had a prenup he said i don't i have to go through it again so  she's got one of the greatest bodies out Yeah it’s not easy I have a lot of options you know the national enquirer howard did a story on me not so long ago that in the history of the world obody has gotten more beautiful women than i have which is a great compliment yes in fact many years ago i was on your show and you were putting all of them up in posters  how was this one how was that  and by the way i'm but you missed quite a few but that's okay so that was a great compliment so melania must have something and you know what it is i've been i believe in the woman behind the man and the man behind the woman but i believe in the woman behind the man i mean i think women don't get it  think take a look at andre agassi he's with brook shields disaster life is a mess right he was the number one player in the world he meets brook shields falls in love marriage he goes to 292 players you know about that i watched him play at the us open three years ago three years ago he got wiped out in the first round he didn't even get a i was like terrible i said isn't it sad he's gotten old all of a sudden he meets steffi graff he's the number one player in the world well steffi graf is a great girl and she's got one of the greatest she's got one of the greatest bodies out here honestly robin well you never get to the face because the body is so good doesn't matter the point is that he are yes here's what happened well it's everything it's not sexual it's the friendship  it's everything the  that you you know what i'm not a big fan of that this show is always a disaster  listen other than the fact this guy's a friend of mine this show's always a disaster straight the last time howard said everything gets really like i always get in trouble in this show and i try and be as nice as i can i try and avoid his crazy questions let me tell you last time yeah howard said very clearly does melania have cellulite now melania is one of the greatest bodies i've ever seen  it's one of the greats does she have to and i said melania doesn't even know what the word cellulite means now i said that very clearly  one of the newspapers in new york did a whole big story on the fact that melania doesn't know what cellulite is like she’s dumb and this is not a dummy so i get killed so almost no matter what you say on the show when they analyze everything i've said today i'm sure they're that was a high picture   no it's not important to me it's not you had kylie backs on this show yeah that's right and she was a friend of mine i don't want to tell you it wasn't look it was the single worst performance i've ever seen  i think you destroyed her in the show when she said she liked the anal and this under that no i didn't do that with them No I did not say that but she was a friend of mine and she was a nice girl and all of a sudden i see her in the show talking about anal and this and  it was on the other night in fact you played it i was like i can't believe this s so she she gave you some really bad answers  so they pay six people two million dollars a piece for a half hour show i'm one person and i have an hour show and i have higher ratings than they do well when i tell them i said so i should be paid 24 million dollars an episode with no ratings  right doing very badly richard branson he's actually a good guy i think that show has a better shot here’s what happened we have a show did you see the ratings this week what was it rated we were the number one show and in fact the new york times did a front page story this sunday that the apprentice was not only number one it was number one since may in other words it's the number one show since may the last thursday  what they did is they opened to 90 minutes be only for one reason because it gets good ratings and it did phenomenally and frankly they would like to have it on for two hours you know on saturday night they put a two-hour version on and saturday night is the biggest saturday night that nbc has had in over a year  i did uh much more than that but yes listen howard it is let me let me tell you let me tell you let me tell you let me tell you the economics and then you'll understand you're saying  i'm getting good money but you know what nbc jeff zucker is so smart and so tough and so good that it's very hard to get money from  they're gonna make a billion dollars and okay let me explain let me explain what happened i signed the first one everyone thought it would be off and you know would do fine it would maybe get a cup and you know then trump goes back to building buildings in manhattan and having a lot of fun having a good life and they paid me peanuts but the show went to number one  and now they said please we beg you let's do more this is very very good so this was a little bit of a surprise it opened strong it opened at number ten it went to eight and five and four and one and the last show you know the live show was 41.5 million people watched the super bowl beat it that was it so it was this monster show so you know people drop to their knees and they say please let's do more so here's what happened i said i'll do more i read an article where the friends people get two million dollars an episode so i said to jeff zucker and everybody at nbc i'll do it but i want friends type money right and they said well maybe we can work something like that out and he said they said they get two million dollars an episode i said no no no there's six of them that get two million dollars an episode and there's one of me  well and then i said six of them so that's 12. right about i'm thinking like howard thinks because i hear he has one of the great contracts in history oh yeah i'm wrong then i said they said well that's ridiculous how dare you suggest that then i said well wait a minute let's go a little further my ratings are higher than friends now by a lot and the other thing is it's an hour program and friends as you know is a half hour  and you know who told me that one i have a golf bro who's mentally i mean he's like really not a smart guy and i'm playing golf and i'm thinking about what am i going to tell nbc and this golf bro comes up to me and he tells me yeah but your show's an hour and friends is a heifer he's obviously a friend's there wife they pay six people two million dollars a piece for a half hour show i'm one person and i have an hour show and i have higher ratings than they do so i said so I said well when i told them i said so i should be paid 24 million dollars an episode i didn't get it,Howard Stern show,2004/9/23,Youtube
8,Donald Trump,"Thank you John it's really wonderful to be back in Detroit and it's a true honor to be back at the Detroit economic Club really terrific people I was here at 2016 so maybe it brought a little luck we're going to do it again we're going to do it again before we begin I want to send our love to everyone affected by the hurricane as you know it was a rough night and uh it's who would have thought a lot of things happening at one time but that's just uh ripped through Florida and also the people of North Carolina Georgia Alabama South Carolina Florida again and Tennessee for what they went through with hurricane hurricane Helen we had uh quite a quite a combination I'd like to congratulate governors of Florida Ron DeSantis Governor Brian of Georgia and South Carolina Henry McMaster they were really hit hard and they've done really a fantastic job the federal government on the other hand has has not done what you're supposed to be doing in particular with respect to North Carolina they've let those people uh suffer unjustly unjustly and we're praying for all of those who lost a house or much more importantly a precious loved one and there were many actually many many in Georgia and North Carolina Florida will rebuild and come back strong it always does I look forward to returning very soon we'll be there very soon and okay now let's get to the uh reason that I'm here today I think you're going to find some interesting things both good and bad but we make the bad into good that's what we like to do it was just announced that inflation came in substantially hotter than expected last month double what was predicted with much of the gain coming from food prices going up rent and housing costs going up and car prices going up interest rates as you know are also a big factor they're very high they've gone from 2% when I was in office to 10% now and you can't get the money that means it's much higher than 10% which really kills the American dream for young people we have a lot of young people here a lot of college people here the fact is that the Federal Reserve brought the interest rates down a little too quickly it was too big a cut and everyone knows that was a political maneuver that they tried to do before the election but they did the wrong thing it was totally a political decision and uh inflation has started to rise four years ago when I left office we had no inflation we had virtually just think of it we had virtually no inflation for the entire four years so when people made money that was really their money it wasn't money that they have to give back to a source that they know nothing about including government under Biden and Harris because of inflation the economy has been a total disaster but Kamala says that she can't think of one thing that she would do differently she said that two days ago in a very unfortunate interview for her and there were many people saying and particular highly respected analyst like Scott bessent one of the top analysts on Wall Street that the only reason that the sock Market has gone up is because Donald Trump is doing very well in the polls and it looks like he's going to win a lot of people are saying that who knows but a lot of people are saying that the only way to end this suffering is to vote for change this November because what we're doing is our country is very bad we're being scoffed at and left at all over the world the other big news is the fraud committed by 60 Minutes in CBS together with the Democrat Party working together with them which will go down as the single biggest scandal in broadcast history I predict it's a big story I don't know if you've seen it yet happened they learned about it yesterday evening the real answer of Kamala was uh very crazy or or done nobody knows what but it was bad so they actually replaced it think of this they've never done that for me they've actually they actually replaced it with another answer having nothing to do with what she said before they took another thing that she said and they just lopped it in there nobody's ever seen anything like it 60 Minutes nobody's ever seen and uh they wanted to make her look as good as possible make her look better a problem in our country is the fake news we have such fake news I mean I've had a recent thing where uh as an example an Obama disciple named Peter Baker he writes for the failing New York Times he wrote a piece about me and just one of the many things he said that was wrong but he said that uh I would go around saying that I was honored here years ago as the man of the year or whatever and uh I talked about how your car industry this was long before many years before I ran for president maybe 18 20 years ago and he made the statement that that never took place that honor never took place I was never honored here which was quite insulting actually I didn't remember the specifics of it it was 18 or 20 years ago but he said it it never took place very much like Kamala she said she worked at McDonald's and she didn't and I didn't want to get into that so what I did is I asked my people you got to find it when it was like 19 years 7 it was a long time but I was honored and guess what they found that I was right here nice looking young guy that was a long time ago so this was in uh let's see this was an update of the article that they originally printed it says Oakland County GOP to honor Donald Trump former president to speak at upcoming Lincoln Day fundraising dinner and it says down here the county party gave Trump The Man of the Year award at the dinner too and uh he was honored as man of the year so here's your article right here Oakland Press Oakland County GOP to honor Trump and I have a man in the failing fake New York Times disgraceful paper they ought to be a as sham they make whatever they say believe the opposite who knows how long they're going to be around it's it's killing it's killing our country this kind of stuff it's killing our our country it's really terrible I want to thank the president of the Detroit economic Club Steve Gregorian who who's a very wonderful guy as well as congressman John James Ambassador David Fisher Michigan Senate Republican leader Eric Nesbit thank you Eric it's great where is ER thank you very much how are we doing I hear we're Four Points up how we doing huh yes he says at least it thank you Michigan house Republican leader Matt Hall a very good guy thank you Matt thank you is John there John John James where is John he's doing well we have some good people here chairman of Michigan Republican Party Pete HRA Pete Pete thank you very much Pete and a very special man a a great guy Dr mad bullas many of you know him he's a very successful man he happens to be the father of Tiffany's husband Michael who's a very exceptional young guy and she's an exceptional young woman so and she's going to have a baby so that's nice thank you for being here thank you very much thank you great honor and many other distinguished guests and we have some very uh very distinguished Democrats in the room too and I really do appreciate you being here this very nice thank you there'll be a day when we're going to work together I hope we're going to be able to work together that would be  great good for everybody but I'm here today to talk about a subject that has always been very dear to my heart saving the US Auto industry that's what I spoke about in Oakland many years ago I went I said they're stealing your Auto industry years ago they're stealing your Auto industry you got to stop it well they didn't exactly listen but we have to uh make that industry bigger better stronger and more Dynamic than ever before and I've been reading about Detroit for so many years that it's coming around it's coming around and never really got there uh everybody tries so hard but if you make the Auto industry bigger better strong you don't have to worry about Detroit it'll be very good it'll come by its own that would be non artificial that would be the way to do it right you make the Auto industry thrive bring it back to where it was 50 60 years ago you can do that too and that's my goal and I'm laying out a policy that will absolutely do it in my opinion absolutely do it and I've been very good at this over my life so my goal is to see us auto manufacturing even greater than it was in its prime and for Detroit and Michigan to be at the center of the action for Generations this city and state were the world capital of automotive production and American automakers rolled one iconic model off the line after the next the Mustang the Corvette the Pontiac GTO I had two of them actually I had that GTO Oh I thought I was the hottest guy around it was crazy we didn't have all of the foreign competition then he were so proud to have the Corvette or if you had a Corvette I never got a Corvette I tell you I feel I I was left behind but I had my GTO I was something man I'd put that top down see in those days I didn't mind when the hair waved I'd go fast and that hair would be waving that blunt hair and I'd say who the hell can take me nobody today I'm a little more careful I wanted to be I want cover up that little area up there a little bit soft up there cover it up now it was it was great but you did you had the greatest product it was just fantastic and right here in Detroit Americans invented the muscle car and the minivan and the family SUV so much and along the road you made the American Automobile and Inseparable part of the and it was Inseparable of the American dream it was part of the American dream but after decades and Decades of Michigan Auto Workers giving our nation their very best our leaders in Washington did their very worst for them they were terrible you lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs after globalist politicians gave us the twin disasters of NAFTA which I terminated and China's entry into the World Trade Organization that was a very expensive two things nearly a quarter of a million jobs were destroyed here right here in Michigan alone think of it quarter of a million 250,000 jobs including 40% of all of the auto jobs and then it got to be much higher than that Detroit was decimated as if by a foreign army this was a foreign army invading us but it was an army of business people very brilliant business people that took the candy out of our pockets just like you take it from a baby that's how easy it was was for him factories were left in Ruins beautiful hotels and theaters crumbled more than 80,000 homes were abandoned you see it outside by the time I came into office after our victory in 2016 the Michigan Auto industry was on its knees begging for help gasping and really it was at the last breaths of life and I had to move quickly you're going to not have any Auto industry here you were it was going it was all gone it was just about over they were going to move so fast and I let countries that were stealing our businesses know you do that I'm going to do things to you you're not going to believe I'm going to put tariffs they they laid off a lot they could have taken it we were at a very vulnerable point I let certain countries know that if you do that I'm going to put tariffs on you and you're going to you're going to get your asses kicked I'm telling you and they laid off they really laid off but they laid off what they we had not very much left so just as I promised I withdrew from the job killing transpacific partnership in my very first week and the reason I did is that that would have absolutely destroyed your Auto industry you would have had none left it would have been it was a disaster and if you remember Hillary Clinton wanted it and Obama wanted it and then after she read the facts when I did it she came out against it because she said you know he's right she was totally in favor of it but when she said she came out actually and agreed with me and she said uh I'm also against it but I was there it's sort of like no tax on tips and then two months later Kamala came out no tax on tips and it didn't it didn't play well for her didn't play well for Hillary either obviously I ended the disaster known as NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made by our country and replaced it with the brand new usmca Bob lighthiser and his team did a great job the best trade deal they say ever made I actually think maybe I deal with China but I don't talk about that deal very much because of covid but we have a deal with China where they buy $50 billion worth of our product that was a great deal we had made a lot of good ones but with the usmca that's Mexico and Canada we have massive incentives to make cars in the United States of America I renegotiated Obama's Korea trade deal which was a disaster to fully restore the protective tariff on foreign pickup trucks you know the Auto industry in this country makes most of its money from the pickup truck who would think right but we do great if we didn't have that you'd have no Auto industry you would because that subsidizes other things and the only reason it does is that the Tariff on every single one of the big if you didn't have the tariffs if I didn't put those tariffs you would be inundated with from all over the world and you wouldn't have it every single one of the big Detroit the Detroit big three could right now and would right now guaranteed be out of business 50% of their Us sales are pickup trucks think of that 50% they make all their money with the almost all their money I want to be very accurate because you got a lot of fake news back there I want to be extremely accured they came they came to see you in Detroit I'll tell you that's a good thing because they're going to hear some things today I think think that are going to be very interesting perhaps most importantly I imposed a 27.5% tariff on all Chinese automobiles which largely kept them out of the market meaning kept them out of the market and kept Detroit in business in other words I kept China cars Chinese cars out of America and we had to do it because when they come in they take over everything and you would have had no car manufacturing at all and it was only me that did it I met with a lot of resistance and remember this between the lobbyists and everything else it's it's brutal it's brutal getting people to go along with you is brutal even if it's the wrong thing they know it's the wrong thing but they get paid a lot of money so I just want to say Michigan you're welcome because we have a little base to start and if you look at Europe if you look at Europe Chinese cars have been absolutely drowning Europe drowning it it's killing it but because of me they are not drowning America you see very few of them because of the tariffs and when they do come in they pay a lot of money the Biden Administration is thinking of taking that tax off and if they take that tax off you can wave goodbye to your Auto industry and you have the worst Union Leader probably in the history of maybe in the history of our country for any business I don't know him Shan Fain is a  disaster but your industry would be gone very quickly under my leadership we created nearly half a million brand new manufacturing jobs including 30,000 auto manufacturing jobs right away we saved it and we got it going and that was nothing compared to what I'm talking about now nothing because we had covid come in in that final period and we had a focus on that share of cars sold that were domestically produced increased from the first for the first time in many years it actually because it was going down down down and since I left way you hear those numbers the US trade deficit in automobiles dropped by $6.8 billion think of that and I had to do it on the Fly we had to do it fast because you were going to have no industry whatsoever whatever you have now and it's a fraction of what you used to have in the Glory Days I call them the Glory Days that was when we were the greatest in so many ways us steel look at it they want to sell us steel to a foreign country I I'm going to not let that happen I hope the deal doesn't close before then I will not let that happen we need our seal you know I imposed a tremendous tariff on China and the steel they were dumping steel all over the country and our steel mills were going out of business and I put a 50% tariff on and that largely stopped it and I think the people that that like me the best of the steel people because I save their IND we wouldn't have one steel plant in this country if I didn't do that there wouldn't be one and I had no Wars but other than I finished off Isis very quickly but I had no  Wars but whether you have wars or don't have wars when you have to make army tanks and when you have to make planes and everything else that you have to do is mostly steal and we don't want to be in a position where we have a problem and we need China to help us out with steel that could that could be a serious problem uh do you think they'd mind selling us some Steels in the middle of a conflict but I don't think we'll have a conflict with China I think we'll get along with China and I think we'll get along with Russia and I think we'll get along with Ukraine and I think we're going to get that one settled and I think we're not going to have a problem with Israel like October 7th would never have happened Russia would have never happened they would have never gone into Ukraine had I been president but under Cala we are now in a manufacturing recession with manufacturing Contracting in 22 think of this it got smaller in 22 out of the last 23 months it got smaller it loses we're losing jobs every single month we've lost nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs this year alone car sales are down by 38% since I left the share of domestically produced cars sold has dropped significantly and the US trade deficit in automobiles has exploded by nearly $50 billion to an alltime High the worst they've ever had it right now your car industry is going out of business it's going out of business nothing to do with me I stopped that I stopped Mexico which is becoming the second in China I stopped Mexico from taking your car plants and moving them into Mexico and taking all of the all of that business making it in Mexico so we lose all those jobs in Michigan and South Carolina and other places we have many Tennessee we have many places but I think in terms of this because it's been so badly treated this this area this state has been so badly treated by your politicians your stupid politicians what they've done to this state is incredible and it would have been easy to stop but half of them are paid a lot of money by a lot of bad well a lot of people that don't care about the country they care about how much money they're going to make including lobbyists and others make a lot of money you ever see the money the lobbyists make they make a lot but they give a lot of it away I wonder who they give it to but we're not going to allow this horror to to continue the fouryear long nightmare for the American Auto worker ends the day I take the oath of office January 20th it    ends yeah the poll a poll just came out today I just as I was walking on they said sir your Four Points up in Michigan I said that's all but they said if what by a poll that they call it a democr poll it's a poll that would normally be very negative so if they say four points that means more but I think we're doing well here and I think we're doing well all over we're leading in every single state every swing state by actually in some cases a lot today I am announcing a detailed plan to save the American Auto industry and bring millions and millions of jobs back to our Shores and very  quickly if you vote for Trump and you will see a mass Exodus of manufacturing jobs but from Mexico to Michigan from Shanghai to Sterling Heights and from Beijing to right here in beautiful Detroit way till you see Detroit and they'll also be going to places like South Carolina Tennessee and others we have lot of car making States a lot of parts making states too and our car industry will have a Renaissance the likes of which we have never seen before in this country we have never seen since the golden years it's my goal to get our country on an automaking path where at some point in the near future it will be bigger and more important than it ever was and even in its Heyday many years ago it was unbelievable I think we can be bigger and more important because we have some very very great assets and this is very personal for me personal one of the reasons is because I've been talking about it for 20 years I can't believe it happened that was the when I was honored that's all I talked about I I was watching this happen it was at that time Japan Japan was just taking our cars like we were a bunch of babies I always say candy from a baby that's how easy it was now it's Japan but it's China and it's a lot of countries this was one of the biggest reasons I ran for president in the first place you know it was probably the Auto industry that was most abused you were the most abused there a lot of industries that are abused we stopped it but now I could put the break so not only stop I now know the game a little better you know I had never been a politician before I got to the White House I said uh yeah I've never done this before but I had to learn and and I had some great people Bob ligher was great our trade representative but we had some people that I didn't like I wouldn't have picked in retrospect we had some clinkers but but you have to understand I just got there I was only in Washington 17 times and I never stayed over so I wasn't a part of Washington Society I didn't it wasn't my thing I was New York person developer did great and I knew New York but I didn't know Washington so I came I had to rely on people sometimes I'd rely on rhinos and that's what I'd get I'd get a rhino and uh that wasn't so good but we had mostly great people but we had some ones that I would not have again and uh we're going to finish the job that we really brilliantly started because we we had numbers that the Ambassador gave you some of them I don't want to bore you by going through it but uh he gave you some numbers that were unprecedented I intend for the Triumph of theer American Auto industry to be among my greatest legacies I want it to be a legacy I want American companies to not only dominate the American Market but also the foreign markets as well they buy so many of our cars it's so so horrible but you know they only buy them if they're made in their countries China I don't object look president she was and and I would would say is a very good friend we broke up a little bit you know the way friendships break up a thing called the China virus broke us up I think that's understandable right cost the world about $50 trillion dollar and tens of millions of lives all over the world I think that's a reason but no I've always had a very good relationship with them very very strong smart man he's strong and smart meaning he wants to take your Auto industry and so does every other leader of a country they want to take your industry all of our industry and we're not going to do that we won't let we won't let them play that game and it's not even hard and you'll understand that in a moment I want German car companies to become American car companies I want them to build plants and America otherwise I'd rather not have their cars here instead of American workers worrying about losing their jobs to foreign Nations I want foreign Nations to be worried about losing their jobs to America that's going to happen going to happen it's going to happen and I hope the Democrats will will go along with us but we'll get it done one way or the other I hope they're going to go along with us it's so good it's like so many things they don't like voter ID why aren't they approving voter ID Democrats don't want voter ID you know why because they want to cheat but they don't want to I say oh they don't when I first thought I thought I was seeing things I thought I was like did I didn't hear that when I first started this they' say the Democrats will not approve voter ID and it's only gotten worse uh Gavin nusum the governor of California just passed a bill had a he signed a bill that you're not even allowed to ask anybody whether or not they have voter ID not only can't you use it you can't even ask I think it's a crime or something I could ask the Secretary of State no I think it's a crime I think it's a crime if you ask somebody do you have ID voter ID let's lock that guy up in other words it's not a crime to vote illegally but it's a crime to ask whether or not there's only one reason for that you know the reason cheating they want to cheat it's only one reason it's crazy no country in the world has a policy like that mail and voting is all gone all over the world all these things that we still fight over they're all gone so we have to win a big election and we're going to straighten it out but we got to straighten it because you have two things you have borders and you have good elections you got to have and it would be nice to have a free press which we don't have at all we have a terrible press but those three things we have and we have to straighten it  out so here is the deal that I will be offering to the world to companies outside of our world big companies powerful companies that have become powerful because we were stupid we were stupid we allowed them to come and en raid and rape our country that's what they did oh he used the word rape that's right I used the word r raped our country the United States will give you the lowest taxes the lowest energy course we have more Liquid Gold under our feet than any other country in the world and it's the best it's the best we have the most and we have the highest quality we have the lowest regulatory burdens and they were going to be made low you know I cut I cut regulations more than any president in history in a four-year term I cut more than any president by four times they say four times I let the country do what they have to do a lot of those regulations have been put back on by crooked Joe and by Kamala and it angers me so much because it's so bad people shaking my hand backstage sir we had the best four years we've ever had and now they're dying they think they're going so many people that tell me they're going out of business now and free access to the best and biggest Market on the planet we're going to give anybody that comes in free access to the best and biggest Market anywhere in the planet that's here but we got to keep it that way because if we keep going like this we're not going to have the best or biggest market for long but only if you make your products here in America in other words you get all of these assets but you have to make your product here in America and you have to hire American workers and if these companies don't take the deal you know we're lowering the taxes way down then they'll have to pay a tax when they or tariff when they send their car or product into the United States and we will use the hundreds of billions of dollars and tariff dollars to benefit the American citizens and pay down our debt in short a period of time it's going to be very quick think of it in a short period of time our de deficit of about $1.8 trillion I've heard it was 2 trillion it's never been anywhere close to this by the way $2 trillion a year will be reduced to practically nothing and eventually our country will be making substantially more money over and above cost and we will start a massive debt reduction and also further tax cuts in other words what I'm doing is I took it from almost 40% your taxes I reduced them to 21% so that small corporations everybody even inheritance tax or a death tax if you have a small business and you want to pass it on to your son and daughter if you love them if you don't love them I would say just don't even bother listening to this part is there anybody in the group that does not love their children is where they where you want to raise your hand and say sir please don't waste our time with this but on the Assumption you want to leave it to your children then uh you have no state tax or death tax they want to end that immediately and it really pertained to Farms where a farm could be valuable but they don't have cash they have a valuable farm and they love their farm and they want to be Farmers it's a great way of life people love it they they wouldn't want to do anything else but they left the farm and then they have to pay a tremendous tax and they borrow the money from the bank and within two three years many almost I guess 62% of the time they say they end up losing their Farm to the banks I got rid of that no there's no estate or death tax at all for the farmers and small business owners that they want to end that it's a big  deal but I brought it down from almost 40% to 21% and now and that makes us very competitive in the world don't forget the world is like States used to be the world people will take their businesses and they're loyal to their stockholders and in many cases the people that run the big businesses are not American they couldn't care less for our country they follow the dollar or they follow we better keep them following the Dollar by the way we're going to keep them following the dollar that'll be another thing cuz that's we're losing that fast we are losing that fast but we're going to bring it down if we brought it down to 21 that made us competitive not the best at all but competitive now I'm bringing it down to 15% but that's totally subject to you building your product making your product in America and I had calls so we're getting it down to 15 and now you're just about the most competitive other than certainly for a big country but you're just about the most competitive at 15 that's the beauty they're going to all move back they're going to all move back they're all coming back and then we're going to protect them so they don't get hurt hurt with tariffs on people that aren't building here and they're going to come in and they're going to build here because they don't want to pay those stiff tariffs so we will build this policy and it's called Build It in America plan it's Build It in America because when foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs my answer will be very simple Build It in America you don't have any tariffs build it right here in Detroit you don't have any tariffs build it in Dearborne or land or Grand Rapids or Flint you don't have any taxes you don't have any taxes or tariffs or anything so we're going to take that we're going to take that remember we started at 40 everyone said you'll never get it down to 30 I got it down to 21 and that caused the biggest Renaissance in the history of our country we had the greatest period of success in the history of our country we did more Revenue you at 21% than we did at close to 40% people were going wild businesses were flourishing small businesses were going through the roof big businesses I was allowing them they'd have hundreds of billions of dollars apple as an example they brought in hundreds of billions of dollars we had restrictive covenant where they couldn't bring money back into our country two reasons the tax was too high it was so ridiculous nobody would do it you had to pay 50 60% tax so you bring money so they said well we'll just leave it there and we'll develop in Europe or Asia wherever the money was but think of this we brought in trillions of dollars because they made it possible I made the tax rate Fair reasonable like a reasonable person would bring it in for a reasonable tax and also I made the bureaucracy very easy they had to hire four different law firms to get their money back if they wanted to bring it back so what I'm proposing very simply then is a 15% made in America corporate tax rate cutting it from 21% all the way down to 15% but only for those who make their product in the USA it's very simple and beautiful and I was and I was called by a couple of the top people in Wall Street I sort of know a lot of them they said who gave you that idea it's so simple I said you know it's a great idea I have another one coming up for you that you're going to like just as much you're going to love maybe more oh you got a big one coming toward the end I want to save it for the end this way you're going to stay around and going to be so happy just pins and needles you're sitting right no I have a I have one coming that I think is just uh incredible but this is something that um is going to revolutionalize our country because it's not only auto companies it's also others but I think in particular this is going to be something that is going to really lead to the Renaissance in Detroit and in our country but in Detroit this place will be booming this place is going to be booming and when you couple that with what I'm going to say in a little while it's going to really be booming so us-based car makers and manufacturers will also be rewarded with expanded research and development tax credits very substantial where they will be able to write off one 100% of their cost of heavy machinery and other equipment necessary to build a plant in the first year and full expensing for manufacturing Investments and all helping to build the sprawling state-of-the-art plants our country needs to be an industrial superpower in the world I have a friend who makes plants he builds plants that's what he does better than anybody in the world and I said to him he's a supporter actually I said to him I want to see a plant I want to see a really great Auto Plant where would we go let's go see one and he said uh well we'll have to go to Mexico I said what we have to go to Mexico I said I want to see Mex I want to see here he said well the big ones are really built in Mexico they're building some really big ones right now you know your stupid Union Leader Shan Fain or whatever the hell his name is this stupid stupid guy he's playing around all electric cars everything else did you see your numbers in the last few months what's happening you're losing your whole business they building the biggest plants in the entire world this guy builds them that's what he's good at if you said build an apartment he wouldn't want to do it he couldn't do it but he can build an auto plant all the top of the line all automated you press a button and the plant opens up biggest in the world and you know who's building them China uh they're building them at levels that nobody's ever seen before right across the border and they think they're going to make cars there and they're going to put you all out of business and they're going to sell them across the border and they're not going to have a tax no they're wrong they're going to pay 100% or maybe even a 200% tariff because we're not going to let them come in to our country and Destroy what's left of our Auto industry because it's a failing industry just like it's a failing country right now we're failing country you know we're a nation in Decline I hope you know that doesn't make me feel good to say it but we're not going to be a nation in Decline for very long perhaps the most important element of my plan to make America extraordinarily wealthy again has to do with reciprocity it's a word that's very important in my plan because you know we generally don't charge tariffs I did I started that process it was so great with the the Vans and the small trucks Etc I told you about but we really don't charge I mean China will charge us a 200% tariff Brazil is a big charger the biggest charger of all is India India is a very big charger we have a great relationship with India I did and with especially the leader Modi it's great leader great man really is a great man he's brought it together he's done a great job but they probably charge as much I mean I think they probably charge more than in many ways China but they do it with a smile you know they do it sort of a nicer charge they thank you so much for purchasing from India Harley-Davidson came to the White House long time ago during my third year second year and I met with them and uh they were based I guess in Wisconsin and uh I said how's business good good what what are the bad cont countes Well India is very tough and they gave me some others why tariffs I say why why uh what are they and they had said like 150% some massive amount I said so do you sell many motorcycles and because you think people want to buy a Harley right anyway no we sell very few in India but they want us to go there they said if you go there and build your plant there we're not going to charge you anything I mean you can do whatever you want I said I don't like that and uh lo and behold I see they went and they built the plant and now they they do their business with India they probably do it outside of India too plenty they built a very big plant uh many countries they do that and then all of a sudden you hear that they're leaving Milwaukee or they're leaving wherever they may be located it's very sad to see it and it's so simple I mean you know this isn't like Elon with his rocket ships that land within 12 in on the moon where they wanted to land or he get that's the engines back that was the first I really I said who the hell did that I saw engines about 3 four years ago these things were coming cylinders no wings no nothing and they're coming down very slowly landing on a raft in the middle of the ocean someplace with a circle boom reminded me of the Biden circles that he used to have right he'd have eight circles and he couldn't fill them up but then I heard he beat us with the popular vote I I don't know I don't know couldn't fill up the eight circles I always LED those circles they were so beautiful they were so beautiful to look at in fact the person that did them that was the best thing about his the level of that Circle was great but they couldn't get people so they used to have the Press stand in those circles because they couldn't get the people then I heard we lost oh we lost no we're never going to let that happen again but we've been abused by other countries we've been abused by our own politicians really more than other countries I can't blame them we've been abused by people that represent us in this country some of them stupid some of them naive and some of them crooked frankly but interestingly it's often those allies that we consider to be friends that have been the greatest abusers we have some great abusers I give you an example the European Union sounds so nice the European Union of countries oh it's so nice they're brutal we have a $200 billion doll deficit with them now higher than that 250 something and uh like I asked at the time angala Anga how many Chevrolets do we have in the middle of Berlin oh I do not know Perhaps Perhaps none you're right Angela yeah right how about Frankfurt how many do we have how many Fords do we have in Frankfurt oh I don't think KY and yet they send their cars to us like a bunch of dummies we are BMW Mercedes Volkswagen by the millions and millions and millions and we're not doing that we're not doing that crap anymore okay now they're going to have to play by our rules they're going to have to play by our rules but China of course was the biggest abuser I mean they were a professional abuser they uh did things to us and they go down as a developing Nation we are a developing Nation well we're a developing Nation too just take a look at Detroit Detroit's a developing Detroit's a developing area hell of a lot more than most places in China so we're not going to let this happen any longer and I don't think it'll be Pop I don't think it'll be possible for bad politicians to stop I don't think so because we've suffered too long and too hard and I fixed much of it during my four years but felt that uh During the covid period it would not be the right time to be going doing this with countries I renegotiated with Japan I renegotiated with South Korea I renegotiate with many but you know with the co uh everybody was just literally devastated by that Scorch it was devastated it was not the right time so I had to slow it up a little bit I was hitting them really hard um Abby Shinzo Abby was great he was assassinated what a great man he was but I went to Shinzo I said Shinzo we have to I got to know him very well he was really a friend of mine he was a great great man actually loved by the Japanese people he he got sick he had to take a leave of absence for a period of time but he was going back and he would have gone back and easily gone back and he was just getting ready to do it he was he was much better I think he was probably cured of what he had and uh he was going back but I said to him Shinzo we have to talk about trade I'm sorry to bring it up I'm sorry this is the most one-sided deal I've ever seen you send millions of cars to us and we can't send you a car they didn't accept any of our cars you send all of your farm products us and you don't want to accept our farm products I'm sorry sh so we're going to have to negotiate something he looked at me he goes I know I said what do you know he said well I know that you were going to be coming back to me and I know that it hasn't been fair I said well how did it happen he said Well we'd ask for things and the Americans would agree to it your representatives your Presidents Republicans too by the way I'm not talking just Democrats he said we would we were friends he would say this I probably wouldn't say it if he were around because it's not very nice but he told the truth he said I said how did you get these deals he said we would ask and they would approve and we were amazed ourselves but I knew you'd be coming to see me and I said I have to see you Shinzo and we made a new deal with Japan but we were stuck with an old one so I couldn't negotiate as good as I normally would but we made it palatable and we were going to really make it palatable when this one came up but he was great but he looked at me I'll never forget it quite he said he called me Donald Donald I knew I knew that you would be coming back because I knew that you understood it but he also said that other people didn't it was you know actually it was quite sad actually and it's that way I would I would look at these deals and say who who negotiated these deals they were so bad it's amazing that we even exist but we have we have 36 trillion in debt we do have 36 trillion we can't forget that so it's not like OG gee that's been you know we've been a little bit unlucky or something no we've been just for years and years and years we've been accumulating we have these deficits that are monstrous we had five six 7 800 billion deficit it with China just alone with China and today it was announced we have the highest deficit we've ever had almost $2 trillion dollar think of that we have almost two and we have the highest deficit we've ever had with with China and that won't last long it's not going to last long we'll be able to do something about it because China wants to do business with us but they think we're stupid they think we're stupid people and then they see a president and then they see a person that is representing the Democrat Party and got no votes and was the first one out she was the first one out think of it she was the first one out she never made it to Iowa 22 people running and she was the first one to quit and now she's running and it's all right but nobody's ever had a run against two people before first I had to run against him then we had the debate and his numbers weren't good and you know looked like he was going to lose so they said you're going to lose lose and we want you out and eventually he agreed to go out he didn't want to he's very he's a very angry man by the way and he hates her and then it was a question they have a person in the state who some people talked about they had a lot of people but they had about 12 people and they put her in 12 people plus her she was number 13 she was rated number 13 there 12 people that they wanted more but they didn't want to be politically Incorrect and they chose her and we're running against her but if she gets in it'll be a disaster for this country basically if a country or any country is charging us tariffs very important reciprocal if they're charging us tariffs for a certain product or tariffs at all if they're charging us tariffs at all which almost all of them do then we will likewise charge them tariffs and we will quickly reciprocate in other words we have countries that are charging us 150% tariff and we charge them 2% and I actually went to a politician a senator from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania you'll figure out because he wasn't able to run because I wouldn't endorse him because I called him the anti- Tariff person I thought he was not a bright person and he was one of the few that said no no we cannot charge tariffs I said but they're charging us 150% so can we charge them 100% sir no we can't why it's not free trade I said really not free trade well what about them no sir it's not free trade can we charge them 50 they're charging us 150 can we charge them 50 he goes no sir it's not free trade I said you're either the dumbest human being I've ever ever mad or you're a crook one or the other and he's no longer a senator he decided not to run but I think it was a disgrace I had a lot of problems with him but basically one of two things will happen they're going to call us or I will call them and say look we can continue to play this game or we can save a lot of energy and pain and bookkeeping and we'll just all drop the tariffs right we'll just all drop the tariffs or we can get paid royally every time a shipment of their goods comes to our Shores and we'll make a lot of money one way or the other we win but its reciprocity will probably I think for the most part they're going to drop the tariffs right now they're not going to drop them we have Ser we have countries that are charging us 100% 150% think of it and we charge them nothing it's been it's been a pillaging of our country it's been a terrible terrible thing this has been going on for a long time I started changing it a lot fast H I changed it with a lot of countries or a lot of countries don't like me you know I get always bad publicity this one doesn't like me Germany doesn't like me a lot of countries don't like me they say who do you like better sleepy Joe Biden or Trump oh I like Biden better yeah because he didn't let them do what they're doing he hasn't doesn't have a clue the guy he just goes to sleep at 4:00 every damn day he doesn't have a clue and he's destroying you know they're destroying our country you see that's the real threat to democracy stupid people that's the threat our biggest threat to democracy is stupid people  but there's a third thing that can happen and that's the fact that if they want to avoid this payment and this is the best thing of all they can come in and build a plant or a factory in the United States and spend all of their money and build and I don't care what country it is and they're going to hire American workers and they're going to have a factory in the United States and then you don't have to pay a tariff and W to be beautiful we have job numbers like you've never had before and that's actually to me the best of the three things so it's a very simple thing to understand it mean and they've been doing it for years but they do it very quietly and they do it intelligently and a lot of people don't see what they're doing uh as an example you want to sell cars in China they tell you build your plant in China if you don't build a plant in China we're going to charge you a tariff that you know you're never going to pay it so a lot of people go over to China and they build their plant the only question I have is where do we stop with reciprocity because frankly we have much more to offer and they've been screwing us for so many years that we're allowed to get some of that back so I say do we want to stop on an even basis we won't do this we won't do that or do we want to stop on a basis you don't do it to us but we're going to still do it to you a little bit and I that's where I am I think and in a way they owe it to us you know in a way they in a way they owe it to us because they've been taking advantage of us for decades and in a way and it's made us it's injured us we're injured we're an injured country from trade and uh you know with NATO when I got there 28 countries they had at the time and uh only seven were paid the rest of them weren't paying or they were paying a smaller amount than they were supposed to pay including Germany by the way Germany wasn't P can you believe because they said we're stupid we're going to take care of them anyway why should they pay a lot of the countries felt that way and I made them pay I said you got to pay and one person at a very closed meeting press knew about it a little bit but they never reported it because it was very it was a good thing not a bad thing so naturally you don't hear about that but it was at a meeting and he stood up the head of a country of one of the countries he said so does that mean that if we don't pay you will not protect us from Russia used to be the Soviet Union now it's Russia sort of the same thing I said that's what it means is you will not protect us I said are you delinquent yes let's say we're delinquent I will not protect you under any form you will not be protected and the following day we took in billions and billions of dollars the money came in and stoltenberg the Secretary General a good man he said it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen Obama would come and make a speech and leave Bush would come and make a speech and leave Trump would come and look at the statement and say man because we were almost paying for all of NATO so we were getting screwed on NATO and screwed on trade a double nobody else would have done this is crazy so we're protecting you and you're taking advantage of us on trade I said sorry we're not going to take it anymore but the money came we took in hundreds of billions of dollars in NATO hundreds of billions and by the way they should be paying 3 to 4% not 2% okay they are 2% they should be much higher than that but but uh that's up for whoever is going to be next president I think calet is not going to be high on her list I don't think anything that we're talking about today is high on her list the whole country is going to be like you want to know the truth it'll be like Detroit our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president you're G to have a mess on your hand she destroyed San Francisco she destroyed along with nusum California and uh we're not going to let her do that to this country we're not going to let it happen so we are the piggy bank that everyone wants that someday we will continue along the path we've been really it's been an amazing path it's been a horrible period of time but almost the last four years we will be I will tell you that uh if I get elected we will be a piggy bank stronger than ever before but we will be a fool no longer we will if you get her lose our wealth we're going to lose our power and we'll also lose our Reserve currency status which will be like really losing a war if we lose that it'll be horrible but we're losing it right now you're losing your reserve currency the dollar the dollar so many countries aren't parti look China wants to take that over that's one of the many things that they want to take over we can deal with China you know we can deal with China and we can deal with Russia and we can deal with North Korea Obama at our meeting prior to taking over when I took over it's this ritual had a meeting and he said the biggest problem is North Korea and very quickly it was nasty for a while Little Rocket Man lot of insults remember when he said I have a red button on my desk I said I have one too but mine's bigger and mine works remember that he said that and a lot of people were saying this is getting to be very heated and then he called and he wanted to meet and we met and I got along great with them I I hate to say it because the Press goes crazy when you say that but that's a good thing it's a good thing not a bad thing a lot of nuclear weapons but we got along very well you had no problem nobody was threatened after that got along they're threatened now you could very well end up in World War I right now you're very close to it you're closer than ever this is the closest we've ever come to World War I you are so close to it because you have incompetent people in the white house so that would reduce us if we lose the dollar that would reduce us to Third World status very quickly but again I would come into play and tariffs would come into play and I'd call those countries that want to stay away but they do business they come in and they take our money and they take our jobs like we're like just so easily and I would call them and I say if a country that's say ready to go to China with their currency or someplace else but China is about 99% of the problem in all fairness I would say to them if you do that I'm going to hit you with tariffs like you've never seen before or I'm going to not let you trade with the United States and I'm going to also hit you with tariffs double whammy if you get anything through but you're not because we're not going to do any business with you and they will then call us and they will say sir we have decided that we love the dollar very much and we're going to stay that's what they will say every single time so you know tariffs are very important thing um they need a PR agent to straighten out that word if I was Mr tariff I would say please get me a PR agent I have to straighten out it's one of the most beautiful words in the whole world it's going to make us wealthy again the other word is reciprocity is going to make us wealthy again we're going to be a very wealthy country very quickly very very quickly you know our greatest wealth probably proportionately was in the 1880s and 90s and the early 1900s where we had so much cash they would set up committees they didn't know what to do with their wealth we had such wealth in this country they didn't know what to do with their wealth they had no they they would set up we had so much money all from tariffs there was no income tax and then they went to the income tax stuff and it was a whole different story then you had the depression a lot of people said oh tariffs maybe cause they didn't it wasn't tariffs came in in 1932 after the Depression they tried putting tariffs on to see if they could save they said we got to save this thing but it was it was long gone it was gone I will do this with each and every abandoning country if they abandon us meaning they abandon our currency and our Reserve currency will be stronger than ever before we'll have everybody in there everybody will be happy to be in there including China because I'll tell China the same thing if you want to play games with us we're not going to trade with you you know they make a trillion dollars a year with us they built our military they make so much money I said we're not going to do any business we'll go cold turkey a lot of people would like to do that anyway but we're going to go to cold turkey and we're going to go with 100% And 150% tariffs so if anything does get through you're going to have to pay tariffs you know China is very smart I'll tell you when I put the tariffs on the steel they were very unhappy but they didn't tell me they said it doesn't matter what CH I said oh it doesn't bother them so then ask them for more that was my initial reaction we started at 25% I said they said it doesn't matter and I said AR so ask him for more so we asked him for more 10% it didn't bother him that's what they said but it did bother him but they're great players they great poker players it didn't bother them I said well ask them for more ask them for more more until it bothers them and finally I got a call from presiden she he said you're killing us with the tariffs and then we got along after that you know it's very strange but they're great poker players they're great negotiators all these countries are great negotiators the only one that isn't is the us we're we're the dumb country we're like the pot of gold that's rapidly shrinking so very much like I told them that if they buy oil from Iran I would not be trading with them you know Iran was broke when I left office and I don't want them to be broke I want them to be a strong country I just don't want them to have a nuclear weapon it's very simple and you protect Israel and frankly you protect the Middle East I want to protect the Middle East the whole Middle East and I want I I don't I hate to see this death to everybody people that have nothing to do with anything or being killed all over the place on both sides nobody wants that we have to we have to protect everybody and and China didn't buy any oil I said if you buy one barrel of oil from Iran one barrel I said then you're going to not do any business with the United States and we're going to oppose tariffs if you do get something through very substantial over 100% And they said we'll pass a I told this to president shei he said well pass they didn't do any business and Iran was and I said this to many countries by the way not just China and I mean many countries treat us worse than China you want to really know the truth but we China seems to be the one we talk about but before I came along nobody talked about China they had a free pass they were going you know run silent run low right you know that expression submarine they were nobody knew but uh I woke up our country a little bit but Iran was broke they had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah and I didn't want to see him broke I wanted him to be thriving but I just had to negotiate the only problem was he was the only problem the election took place and it was uh very shocking to a lot of people and when they took over they didn't do anything they didn't do anything they actually did the opposite they allowed everybody to go and buy oil they allowed everybody to do all of those things and Iran became very wealthy again they now have $300 billion in cash they're very wealthy they control Iraq which was a stupid move going Iraq I remember I said don't do it don't do it don't do but I said it as a civilian then they did it I said okay you've done it keep the oil they didn't do that either so we go in we blow up countries and then we leave we got nothing except dead people all over the place on both sides how stupid are we that was a chainy deal and a bush how stupid are we not just Democrats it's both I'm equally angry at both because we have Humanity to think about also you do you have Humanity to think about and all of these things they should have never happened Ukraine should have never happened October 7th should have never it should have never happened if you had smart people at the White House that knew something a little bit of something wouldn't have happened think of the world how different it would be you wouldn't have Ukraine Russia you wouldn't have had October 7th you wouldn't have this horrible thing that's going on you wouldn't have had inflation you wouldn't have had the worst most embarrassing day in our history we were leaving Afghanistan I'm the one that got him down but I would have kept barram you know why I would have kept barram was 1 hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons 1 hour away so you see the ideas and the policy are important but the most important thing of all is the messenger because I could give that same message to a stiff and it wouldn't resonate at all with the other side you have to have the right messenger somebody said oh we love Trump policy but we don't like Trump I think they do they said women don't like me I think women love me because they want to be safe and with me they're safe with other people they're not safe it's true  so remember I want tariffs but a very very big easy and uncomplicated part of it is is reciprocity because that comes along with it very simply and uh all tariffs against our nation must come off they have to come off they got to come off immediately because we're going to meet them with an equal tariff and they will come off for the most part but if they don't they have to pay a big price so next in addition to this rather easy thing to understand by the way does everyone understand this does everybody do you understand is there is there anybody that doesn't understand it would you please raise your hand raise your hand does anybody not understand it see how simple is that I'd like to see the person I really don't sir then they have a front page story that we had a couple of dummies in the room but we will Implement further protections for critical industries that are fundamental to our national interests and those include above oil steel and the car industry the car industry is critical to us we can't fight a war if we can't make cars and trucks and engines and transmissions and drivetrains surrendering our car industry is not an option we have to make our car industry brilliant again we have to make it bigger I'm going to make it bigger than it was ever before now I'm going to make it real very quick it's going to go but to bring that to that level I guess I'll need a little more time but I won't have that time but I'm going to have I'm going to hand it over to people we're going to we're going to make this country so strong and it's going to be so much easier to run and I think we're going to end up actually having a lot of support from the other party I really believe that I think it's too basic it's too basic so as I said China is currently building gigantic Auto plants in Mexico and they think that they're going to sell all of these cars into the United States which would destroy Michigan totally destroy your state but it's not going to happen not going to happen not even close they might as well stop building the damn plants they are giants sure you really have to see them I said I don't want to see them I will impose whatever terar are required 100% 200% 1,000% they're not going to sell any cars into the United States with those plants they're building them close to our border so that they can have easy shipping because they used to having stupid people to deal with we're not going to let it happen those jobs are coming back to Michigan and they're coming back to other states and they're coming back to our country and they're going to make America great again that's it and to that end I'm announcing today that upon taking office I will formally notify Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six year renegotiation provisions of the usmca that I put in that was the hardest thing I had to get they didn't want that they wanted to have it long but I wanted to because there's always like little tricks they want to play I said nope I want to be able to renegotiate in six years otherwise we're not making the deal and I got it and it's coming due very soon oh I'm going to have a lot of fun and that'll address these concerns and I'll will also seek strong new protections against trans shipment so that China and other countries cannot smuggle their products and Auto Parts into the United States taxfree through Mexico to the detriment of our workers and our supply chains they smuggle this stuff in they don't pay anything we're going to have very strong language of that it's not hard once you know about it but nobody no politician knows about it you know and and when they signed an after deal there were some mistakes made typos like typos there were mistakes made and they were going to take care of it the following day 30 years later they said whatever happened like mistakes like on the numbers you know which were always against us nobody ever did anything about it except me I terminated NAA that's a pretty big thing a lot of people said it would be impossible to do I got it done and uh we have a great deal now what we have to do is make it much better even and we'll be able to do that very shortly but while I have the Build It in America plan Camala Harris has the build it in China plan this is really a build it in China plan she's going to destroy our country her plan is so stupid every policy she is rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas most significantly Cala is a giant tax hiker the tax queen they call her is demanding a shocking I don't even to be honest with you after watching her on 60 Minutes and on watching that horrible statement that she made they call it a word salad I don't really like those words because because it was really worse than that but but after watching that I don't think she's interested in 33 I don't think she has any idea what's happening okay I think she's dumber than hell and we've had we've had enough of that for four years we're not going to have it any longer because we're not going to be a country if we have it you you will see that you've got to see no you've got to see and to think that a member of the media under this big press Corp where they get free licensing they shouldn't have free licensing when they do that and they change her answer they take it out throw it away and put in a totally different answer in order to protect her and they get caught CBS should lose their license you know they have a license they have a license which is worth billions of dollars and they pay nothing all of these networks are all crooked as hell you saw that with ABC they go after me not her they go after JD how good is JD doing isn't he doing good they go after JD but not this character this character that calls himself a knucklehead I've never seen that in the debate he said well he's said knuckle I don't want to say I'm a knuckle because I say well I'm a quoting him they'll say Trump just called himself that's how crooked they are so so I say well actually you know it's amazing that he calls himself a knucklehead normally I say you know he calls so I don't want to do that because if I say that they're going to say see Trump called himself a knucklehead no I don't call myself a knucklehead I call myself somebody that wants to make our country great again very simple the tax queen is demanding a shocking 33% tax hike on all domestic production that means that everybody's going to leave our country and go to another country they where they can pay 15 16 18 19% it's very simple it's not that complicated she wants the largest capital gains tax largest gains tax think of this in the history of our country she even plans to tax unrealized capital gains think of it unreal think of what that means it's an unrealized gain and she wants to tax it how do you do that okay she wants to tax and a lot of people are rich but they have no money you know they have good land or they have something or they put all their money into their business because they want to have a business that's going to get better and better and grow and grow but they're rich but they have no cash now they're going to have to go out borrow a lot of money to pay a tax they're going to have to get good appraisers they're going to have to get a lot of accountants the only one going to make money are praises and accountants and lawyers but uh those those people they're all going to leave they're all going to go to other countries so if a company succeeds it must give a lot of its value to the government and if it doesn't succeed the government doesn't take any risk they don't lose but they do lose really because they lose all those jobs and all that all of those important things if the tax queen gets her way every company in the United States will leave I mean they're going to leave they're not staying here here there's such competition for companies it's like a basketball player a baseball player a football player there's a lot of competition no different just bigger numbers all together comm's $4.1 trillion tax hike is projected to reduce GDP by 2% raise the typical family's taxes by at least $3,000 a year lower wages by 1.2% and kill at least a million full-time jobs other than that I think it's quite a good plan it's just crazy I will not let that happen to our country I will keep your taxes low and your job numbers High that's what we're going to do we're going to have the highest job we had the highest job numbers in history in my Administration we're going to make that look like peanuts the theft of our companies factories jobs and wealth by foreign countries is over we are not going to allow it to happen anymore and many of those who left will be coming back and they're going to be coming back fast they want to come back they want to come back I I produced that with the money they took in M we took in hundreds of billions of dollars came back into our Shores once I've made that change in the tax law which I had to get approved by Congress believe it or not next to reduce costs for both manufacturers and consumers I will remove 10 old regulations for every new regulation every time we put on a regulation We cannot put it on unless and I did that and that's what gave us we had it up very high we had about 7 to one it turned out and we we had it up high now we're going to bring it up to a high to a newer level a higher level and I will start by terminating K's insane electric vehicle mandate on day one it's killing our car industry comma EV mandate is killing the US Auto industry it requires that within just a few years 67% of all new cars and trucks must be electric and it doesn't work for trucks at all because of their weight their payload doesn't work at all and because they can't go far I was with the truckers recently because they came to see me because they don't know what to do they say they want us to go all electric with trucks and I was with one man who was a giant in the industry older guy very smart just like 29,000 trucks 29 I said what the hell 29,000 he said yes sir and I've been buying trucks for 50 years and every single damn year those trucks got bigger and better and more efficient and More Beautiful they could carry more payload they could do every single year and then we put apartments on those trucks he go called it an apartment that's on the cab where they put these things where they can live he said and those damn Apartments now are so beautiful that you'd love to live in one of them he said I don't know I'm going to I'm going to leave maral Lago and move into the back of a truck but it it's beautiful I can't think of worse things to be honest with you it's sort of cool right travel all over the country but uh but he said they get better so then I said 'well what's wrong with the electric he said if we go from New York to Los Angeles we have to stop six times and you'll never find a charger but assuming you had Chargers which you won't have they built as you know big story eight charges someplace in the midwest they spent 9 billion doll this is like a gas pump with electricity in it right boom they spent 9 billion ion dollar and three of them don't work now if you did the whole country at that rate it would cost you 10 trillion dollar 10 trillion but they said we have to stop six times and their long stops much longer than fill it up like a tank he said with a big load of diesel we can get all the way and we can even start coming back without a stop and the truck gets lighter as you go along the other thing he said that people don't know is that an electric truck would be two and a half times heavier because batteries are very very heavy and that would mean you'd have to rebuild every bridge in the United States of America because they're not designed for that kind of a weight so every bridge in the United States would have to be rebuilt and also he said couple of other little problems he said the battery is so big it would take a lot of our payload we'd lose 40% of our payload we'd have to have battery in there instead I said so when you you tell them this if you're a child and somebody said that you'd say okay let's think about it in 10 years or 20 years from now doesn't work he said we tell them they said we don't care just we want you're going to order all electric Tru this is like a dictatorship these people are sick now they want to make our army tanks all electric I saved the army tanks up in Ohio where they make come and because I hated the fact that they were closing when I was president-elect I got called from the great Jim Jordan congressman from Ohio in Lia they have a a plant that manufactures the army tanks they were going to close it and I looked I went there the complexity the talent the people they had work in there was incredible and I said we're not closing this plant and now it's the number one producer it's incredible but now they want to make army tanks that are electric because they want to go into a country and blast the crap out of it in an environment ly friendly way but these people are crazy and the problem is the the electric battery is so big and so heavy that it would have to be in like a wagon that a child pulls behind the tank they pull in they'd pull in a battery and it would have to be and it doesn't work they want to make everything electric and yet think about it they want to make everything electric but and I'm a big fan of electric I think it's great there are certain applications I mean Elon Musk endorsed me powerfully okay we love him and you know and his product is incredible in fact he's doing a new product today has got no steering wheel on it do you know that he's he's out in someplace announcing a new product with no steering whe I said well that wouldn't be for me but is that really the future you know he knows I'm giving him full credit I think he's incredible he he gave me the most powerful endorsement he was in Butler with us the other day you probably saw that it was great he said the whole country country he said America will never survive if Trump doesn't get in because he knows the alternative it's two people it's like the alternative is not acceptable he's a strong guy smart guy brilliant but among other things he does the Tesla and it's great but it doesn't mean that everybody has to have that and you know I tell a story about him I'm very close to him I have a lot of respect for him I think he respects me he gave me the strongest endorsement you could ever get but you know he never once came up to me and said you know could you stop knocking electric cars cuz I don't knock them I think they're incredible but it's for a group of people I love them I think they're great but you know it's for a certain group of people where they might work even better but not everybody because some people want to go long distances they will cost more uh you have the fact that they probably are going to be made in China remember this I said we have more oil and gas we have more Liquid Gold under our feet so why would we do the batteries where China has that we have liquid gold so we want gasoline propelled cars but it's even worse than that because Kamala also co-sponsored a bill to impose a 100% ban on the sale of all new gas powerered cars and trucks so she's going to ban them which would kill an estimated 200,000 US Auto jobs including almost every job that you have in a place called Michigan how do you like that idea she has a band she has a band where not going to allow them to be made and honestly for some app like I'm telling you about the army tanks I'm telling you about trucks the battery is not going to work it's not going to work the electrics are just not going to work maybe in 20 years 30 years for who knows but it's not going to work what it will do is drive our country into a depression the entire industry would go to China for the making of these all electric cars and trucks the Auto industry would be non-existent or dead it will be dead it will never be able to survive this is one of the major reasons why I've been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank and file membership of the teamsters including 62% of the teamsters members right here in Michigan they rank and file of the teamsters Nationwide the firemen the policemen the policemen we have 100% of the police there I don't think there's one police person in the whole country that endorses lunatic I don't believe there's one policeman in the country we have we just got the we just got a 400,000 group of police the Fraternal Order it's the biggest group in the country but we've got every just about every Sheriff's group every law enforcement Group is because we're going to stop crime she's not going to stop crime she wants open borders she wants people to pour into our country and destroy our country and to move into your little towns and cities and your big towns and cities too and destroy our country she wants open borders they put a little trap out there couple of months ago they made it a little bit tougher but they didn't stop airplanes from flying in with hundreds of thousands of people coming into our country they're destroying our country we can't let it happen the rank and file of the UAW members are also with us too you know the if you go to the UAW the the Auto Workers they're for us also sha Fain who I never met the head of the United aut workers did a tremendous diservice to the people he represents by allowing the government of the United States to put out an all electric mandate because after I terminate the Mandate my first day in office I will terminate it in my first day we will go back to making electric cars gasoline propelled cars hybrids and anything else that comes along at the time probably hydrogen I'll do without because when they blow up you are unrecognizable I don't like that the hydrogen car they keep talking about hydrogen the problem is when it has a problem it blows up violently so the beautiful woman sitting on the fourth row you'd never recognize her again and somehow I don't want to be able to I'm not going to buy one of those suers I don't care how good they if they say they're really working quite well now that's not going to be good enough but they talk about hydrates and who knows the EV mandate is also a costly disaster for Working Families to comply with camel's quotas automakers are forced to jack up the costs of gas powered vehicles artificially to push consumers toward the very expensive electric alternative so they going to raise the prices on one to subsidize the other that's not a good thing so comma gives U rich people $7,500 tax breaks to buy luxury electric cars a lot of people don't know that yet she makes the working class pay more for a entrylevel car that's powered by gasoline which we have so much of and I will reverse this also this Injustice on day one comma EV mandate is one of the most demented regulations that's been conceived I mean we have a lot of them but this is about as bad as it gets it'll destroy us autom manufacturing immediately it'll destroy our Trucking based supply chain destroy our electric grid destroy our military destroy our roads and bridges with vehicles that are far too heavy don't we can't even use them destroy the state of Michigan and it'll totally destroy our middle class that's why I will not only repeal the federal mandate I will also stop California from opposing any state level mandate to ban gas powered cars and  trucks and it's very simple to solve vote for Trump and the gasoline engine will be here for a long long time they're going to be here for a long time and it's uh they've got it to a point where it gives very little pollution very little it's amazing what they've been able to do but it's what people want it's much less expensive it's what people want the next part of our effort to bring back domestic manufacturing will be to restore the power confidence and the wealth of the American Consumer we have to we have to let them be wealthy again we have to let them make money not give not give money like they did that's also energy what their stupid energy policies caused inflation but also the fact that they gave so much money away that was a very bad thing to do they thought they were going to buy people's votes well they've already spent that money and they paid for it actually more so because of the cost of inflation for them over the past four years comma inflation catastrophe has cost the typical family $29,000 in price hies so inflation has cost them $229,000 new and used car prices are up over 29% average interest rates for new cars has doubled and tripled and quadrupled meanwhile repair and maintenance costs are up 32% car parts are up 22% car insurance premiums what's going on with that some places it's up 100% And the cost of gasoline is up 62% by driving up prices and interest rates common as inflation disaster send car payments way up and Car Sales way down your numbers are terrible by the way for the first time ever the all-in cost of car ownership is now over $1,000 a month never been anywhere near that more than 20% of the median workers wage just to have an average car this is a catastrophe for the American dream and a dire crisis for American automakers one of my top priorities will be to quickly defeat inflation and make America affordable again we will quickly defeat it we have to bring down prices I will cut taxes slash regulations curb wasteful spending and unleash energy production it'll all happen very quickly this will rapidly Drive prices down lower interest rates and put more money into the pockets of American consumers it'll also bring your grocery bill way down I have more complaints on grocery the word grocery you know it's sort of simple word but sort of means like everything you eat the stomach is speaking it always does and uh I have more complaints about that bacon and things going up double triple quadruple as part of this effort I will pass major tax cuts for workers including no tax on tips no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our  seniors and here's what I told you about before the reason all sticking around because I had to make I said do they mind a little bit longer speech because you know it is big it is a big subject no sir they love it and I haven't noticed anybody leaving there was one gentleman over there but he came back he went to the bathroom and what the fake news will do is take a picture of one empty seat say people are fleeing no they don't flee nobody's fleeing nobody's leaving I always watch if they start to leave I just end the speech thank you very much ladies and gentlemen we're going to make America great again enjoy yourself no I do that because often times I lose the teleprompter you know teleprompter go out but she lost the teleprompter last week did you see it she was talking about 32 days to the election and she goes there are 32 days oh oh my God I just lost a tell 32 then she 32 32 32 32 and I said what the hell happened to her and then the teleprompter kicked back on 32 days to the election you don't you don't want this for your president I lose teleprompters probably 5% 10% of the time sometime sometimes I'll be in front of 50,000 people I'll lose a teleprompt you got to wing it you got to you know what you got to do and you can't I just lost my teleprompter ladies and gentlemen how about Biden if he loses his teleprompter so he goes do you ever see him lose it cuz they do go off you know especially outside the wind is blowing I had one in Ohio Bernie Marino I think he has a good chance of winning by the way and the tele it was like 45 mph winds and rainy miserable and I'm saying I can't believe we had a tremendous crowd in fact he went to first place when I made that speech and it's going back and forth like this and you couldn't read it you ever try read and then they blew off the stage I'm stuck up there I said ladies and gentlemen we have just lost our teleprompters I hope you enjoy the rest of the speech and we made a speech and all I know is he won he ended up winning the primaries I was right before the primaries but this is what you've been waiting for because today I am also announcing that as part of our tax cuts we will make interest on car loans fully deductible  so a man who's a lot of you people are in the car industry actually I made a lot of them backstage what do you do I'm in the car industry but a lot of them and I told him about he's a very knowledgeable person he said here's a guy he's done it all his life he's sitting right over there I don't want to embarrass him but he said where did you come up with that idea that's the coolest thing it's like the paper clip again right it's like the paper clip somebody comes up with the paper clip and everybody says why the hell didn't I think of that right somebody came up with a paper slip I guess made a lot of money and other people said Gee but he said you know I've been in the car industry all my life I've never thought about that so we're going to make it fully deductible the interest payments that's going to revolutionize your industry this will stimulate massive domes Domestic Auto production and make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families this is a phenomenal thing if I do say so myself who likes that idea is that great likewise to help small businesses afford the work Vehicles they need to get the job done we will double the amount of equipment investment they can deduct under Section 179 you know what that means so you're going to get tremendous deduction ability this will be great for small businesses and great for Ford and General Motors it'll be great for them and we'll sell cars and trucks and work vans like never before you'll sell so much oh those companies are going to like me and I have nothing to do with them I have nothing to do see another guy would have gotone and seen them yesterday say here's what I'm going to do this is how bad they are they're evil Biden would have gone to see him hey I have an idea but he doesn't have those ideas well hunter gets a half a million bucks of painting and he can't paint he can't paint worth a damn right so that's worse that's much worse as we protect gas powerered cars we will unleash American Energy and bring prices way down fast the day I take office the word will go go out and we are going to Frack Frack frack and drill baby drill and KLA Harris she's been against fossil fuels all her life I she has no idea why she has no idea but she's been against somebody told her but Kamala Harris is doing the exact opposite she's Waging War in American Energy and she's imposed a natural gas export band that I talked about with you before that's currently in effect and she is right now shutting down power plants all across our country ruining our country ruining our electricity pricing and our grid she's destroying our grid prices will SAR by more than 100% driving us into third world status even as she forces us to only buy electric cars think of it we don't have electricity in California you have brown outs and blackouts every week and blackouts I mean the places Stone Cold broke no electricity and this idiot Governor over there that I had a deal with that is really I don't know if it's really for real so you have blackouts brown outs all the time and now he wants to go 100% electric cars and then if somebody wants to build some kind of a plant to make electricity he'll make it impossible for the get what are they doing they're destroying our country they're destroying our country if this continues all Michigan manufacturing will be dead in absolutely no time you won't have any manufacturing because as that industry goes and as the energy goes there goes your businesses as president my policy will be to maximum it's going to be maximum energy production to achieve low prices and make the United States into a Max really a a manufactur I want to be a manufacturing power house we're going to be more powerful than ever before you know AI is a new industry and it's a very big one and uh I don't know it's got some interesting difficulties but China wants it and other countries want it and we've got to be there but you know in order to be able to compete with China or compete even with anybody with AI we have to make double the electricity that we have right now so take all of the electricity we have we have to make we have to double it up just for that one very big industry it's going to be very big but it needs unbelievable amounts of electricity I will cut the price of energy and electricity in half ready 12 months from January 20th and take office on January 20th your electric bill including cars air conditioners heating everything your total electric bill will be 50 50 50% less we're going to to cut it in half and we have it we have the power to do it because we have it we don't need ships we don't need long train we have everything we're going to have to build some pipelines because we can't transport it but that's easy to do and that's safer than trains but we're going to get this done and you're going to have within one year think of it within one year you're going to have electric bills and energy bills and your gasoline for your car is going to be 50 50% cheaper than it is right now that's a big thing that's a big thing but we will seriously expedite our environmental approvals I will exped that if I have to I'll just approve them and approve them because they use that you know they use the environmental approvals to stop progress and quickly double our electricity capacity and we're going to have it doubled and tripled this will drive down inflation and make America and Michigan the best place on Earth to build a Factory and finally as we bring back our economy and our Auto industry and you're going to see an industry that's going to come back so fast they all want to be here but the laws and the regulations and the tremendous crazy taxes and the competition with other countries made it impossible I will continue my first-term efforts to protect America from the threat of Chinese automobiles I will stop Chinese and other countries produced automobile and autonomous vehicles do you like autonomous does anybody like an autonomous vehicle you know what that is right when you see a car driving along some people do I don't know a little concerning to me but but the autonomous vehicles we're going to stop from operating on American roads remember this I will close the loop hols under Biden and Harris that are beginning to allow Chinese vehicles to creep into American they're destroying Europe Europe's car industry is being just decimated this is not just a matter of Economic Security it's a matter of National Security we have to have a car industry and you know that can be swapped in wars that can be swapped and make other things I mean there's so many reasons you have to keep it second world war do you know we built in the second world war we built a ship a day nobody can even believe it today we don't build we practically don't build a ship a year we used to build the second world war we built a ship a day frers and things but a ship a day and today it's not it's crazy we're going to get it back to a position where we can do things like that this is how we will bring back our Auto Parts and bring back our manufacturing and unlock the destiny of the great state of Michigan Michigan's going to be your biggest beneficiary for this we're going to put America workers first first America's Jobs first American cars First America factories first and we're going to put the American people first it's the first time in a long time you've heard that from Commerce to labor to fima boy oh boy have they been treated badly the people of North Carolina and other states Georgia a little bit get some Governors that did a great job but boy the federal government let you down I will work for Americans and only for Americans I want to work for Americans America first it's a very simple policy America first when we do all of this you will witness nothing less than the launch of a new American Industrial Revolution thousands of factories will open up all across our land great paying Blue Collar jobs will lift up those who have suffered so terribly over the past four years you heard the numbers in the Auto industry it's collapsing inflation will come down fast American cars and products will be exported and admired all throughout the world again young people will move from the coasts to big cities into the heartlands to build their fortunes on the New Frontier of the American Midwest they're going to move back instead of leaving they're going to be moving back and I'm telling you right now standing here in the center of this once great City that by the end of my term the entire world will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning Rebirth of Detroit that's going to happen very quickly with your vote we will bring back our country we will rebuild our country and we will reunite our country with American Heart American grit and American hands I want to thank you all for being here this is a great honor it's such an important day to me because I've been talking about this subject for so long and I've watched politicians destroy this area this state this city and it's so easy to fix and we're going to fix it better than anybody ever thought even possible so God bless you all and now I think on top of all that I think I have to answer some questions can you believe it so I'll stay here and I'll answer some questions but thank you all very much and we appreciate it thank you ",Trump economic plan in

Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious Aid throughout this transition they have been magnificent thank you today's ceremony however has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another or from one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people for too long a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed The Establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation's capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land that all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment it belongs to you it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America this is your day this is your celebration and this the United States of America is your country what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people January 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again the Forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer everyone is listening to you now you came by the tens of millions to become part of a a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens Americans want great schools for their children safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves these are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential this American Carnage stops right here and stops right now we are one nation and their pain is our pain their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success we share one heart one home and one glorious Destiny the oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans for many decades we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry subsidize the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military we've defended other nations borders while refusing to defend our and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and Decay we've made other countries Rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has dissipated Over the Horizon One By One The Factory shuttered and left our Shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future we assembled here today our issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every Hall of power from this day forward a new vision will govern our land from this day forward it's going to be only America First America First every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on Foreign Affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families we we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs protection will lead to Great prosperity and strength I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down

10,Donald Trump," MR. SPEAKER, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS, LESS THAN ONE YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE I FIRST STOOD AT THIS PODIUM IN THIS MA I MAJESTIC CHAMBER TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS, THEIR HOPES, AND THEIR DREAMS. THAT NIGHT OUR NEW ADMINISTRATION HAD ALREADY TAKEN VERY SWIFT ACTION. A NEW TIDE OF OPTIMISM WAS ALREADY SWEEPING ACROSS OUR LAND. EACH DAY SINCE WE HAVE GONE FORWARD WITH A CLEAR VISION AND A RIGHTEOUS MISSION TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR ALL AMERICANS.  OVER THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS AND ACHIEVED EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS. WE HAVE FACED CHALLENGES WE EXPECTED AND OTHERS WE COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED. WE HAVE SHARED IN THE HEIGHTS OF VICTORY AND THE PAINS OF HARDSHIP. WE HAVE ENDURED FLOODS AND FIRES AND STORMS, BUT THROUGH IT ALL WE HAVE SEEN THE BEAUTY OF AMERICA'S SOUL AND THE STEEL IN AMERICA'S SPINE. EACH TEST HAS FORGED NEW AMERICAN HEROES TO REMIND US WHO WE ARE AND SHOW US WHAT WE CAN BE. WE SAW THE VOLUNTEERS OF THE CAJUN NAVY RACING TO THE RESCUE WITH THEIR FISHING BOATS TO SAVE PEOPLE IN THE AFTERMATH OF A TOTALLY DEVASTATING HURRICANE. WE SAW STRANGERS SHIELDING STRANGERS FROM A HAIL OF GUNFIRE ON THE LAS VEGAS STRIP. WE HEARD TALES OF AMERICANS LIKE COAST GUARD PETTY OFFICER ASHLEY LEPARD WHO IS HERE TONIGHT IN THE GALLERY WITH MELANIA.    ASHLEY WAS ABOARD ONE OF THE FIRST HELICOPTERS ON THE SCENE IN HOUSTON DURING HURRICANE HARVEY. THROUGH 18 HOURS OF WIND AND RAIN, ASHLEY BRAVED LIVE POWER LINES AND DEEP WATER TO HELP SAVE MORE THAN 40 LIVES. ASHLEY, WE ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.   WE HEARD ABOUT AMERICANS LIKE FIREFIGHTER DAVID DALBERG. HE'S HERE WITH US ALSO. DAVID FACED DOWN WALLS OF FLAME TO RESCUE ALMOST 60 CHILDREN TRAPPED AT A CALIFORNIA SUMMER CAMP THREATENED BY THOSE TEF STATING -- DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. TO EVERYONE STILL RECOVERING IN TEXAS, FLORIDA, LOUISIANA, PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, EVERYWHERE, WE ARE WITH YOU, WE LOVE YOU, AND WE ALWAYS WILL PULL THROUGH TOGETHER. ALWAYS.    THANK YOU TO DAVID AND THE BRAVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DAVID. GREAT JOB. SOME TRIALS OF THE CHAMBER TOUCHED US PERSONALLY. WITH US TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST EVER TO SERVE THIS HOUSE, A GUY WHO TOOK A BULLET, ALMOST DIED, AND WAS BACK THE WORK THREE AND A HALF MONTHS LATER, THE LEGEND FROM LOUISIANA, CONGRESSMAN STEVE SCALISE.    I THINK THEY LIKE YOU. STEVE. [LAUGHTER] WE'RE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THE EFFORTS OF THE CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER, AND THE DOCTORS, NURSES, AND PARAMEDICS WHO SAVED HIS LIFE AND THE THE LIVES OF MANY OTHERS, SOME IN THIS ROOM, IN THE AFTERMATH --  YES. YES. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT TERRIBLE SHOOTING, WE CAME TOGETHER NOT AS REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS, BUT AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE. BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO COME TOGETHER ONLY IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY. TONIGHT I CALL UPON ALL OF US TO SET ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES, TO SEEK OUT COMMON GROUND, AND TO SUMMON THE UNITY WE NEED TO DELIVER FOR THE PEOPLE. THIS IS REALLY THE KEY. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE WERE ELECTED TO SERVE.  OVER THE LAST YEAR, THE WORLD HAS SEEN ""WE GO HIGHER"" EACH ALWAYS KNOWN -- THAT NO PEOPLE ON EARTH IS R SO FEARLESS, DARING AND DETERMINED AS MENTION. IF THERE IS A MOUNTAIN, WE CLIMB IT. IF THERE IS A FRONTIER, WE CROSS IT. THERE IS A CHALLENGE, WE TAME IT. IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY, WE SEIZE IT. SO LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT BY RECOGNIZING THAT THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG. BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE ARE STRONG.   AND TOGETHER WE ARE BUILDING A SAFE, STRONG, AND PROUD AMERICA. SINCE THE ELECTION WE HAVE CREATED 2.4 MILLION NEW JOBS,  INCLUDING... INCLUDING 200,000 NEW JOBS IN MANUFACTURING ALONE. TREMENDOUS NUMBERS.  AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF WAGE STAGNATION, WE ARE FINALLY SEEING RISING WAGES.  UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS HAVE HIT A 45-YEAR LOW.  THAT'S SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD OF. AFRICAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT STANDS AT THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED.  AND HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAS ALSO REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS IN HISTORY.  SMALL BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IS AT AN AL NAIM -- IS AT AN AL ALL-TIME HIGH. THE STOCK MARKET HAS GAINED $8 TRILLION IN VALUE IN JUST THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE GREAT NEWS FOR AMERICANS, 401(K), RETIREMENT, PENSION, AND COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF, AND JUST AS I PROMISED, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THIS PODIUM 11 MONTHS AGO, WE ENACTED THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. (CHEERING AND OUR MASSIVE TAX CUTS PROVIDE TREMENDOUS RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND SMALL BUSINESS. LOWER TAX RATES FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS, WE NEARLY DOUBLED THE STANDARD DEDUCTION FOR EVERYONE. NOW THE FIRST $24,000 EARNED BY MARRIED COUPLE IS COMPLETELY TAX-FREE.  WE ALSO DOUBLED THE CHILD TAX CREDIT.  A TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR MAKING $75,000 WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILL REDUCED BY $2,000, SLASHING THEIR TAX BILL IN HALF. IN APRIL THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME YOU WILL EVER FILE UNDER THE OLD AND VERY BROKEN SYSTEM, AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL HAVE MORE TAKE-HOME PAY STARTING NEXT MONTH, A LOT MORE.  WE ELIMINATED AN ESPECIALLY CRUEL TAX THAT FELL MOSTLY ON AMERICANS MAKING LESS THAN $50,000 A YEAR, FORCING THEM TO PAY TREMENDOUS PENALTIES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD GOVERNMENT-ORDERED HEALTHCARE. WE REPEALED THE CORE OF THE DISASTROUS OBAMACARE, THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS NOW GONE. THANK HEAVENS.   WE SLASHED THE BUSINESS TAX RATE FROM 35% ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 21% SO AMERICAN COMPANIES CAN COMPETE AND WIN AGAINST ANYONE ELSE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  THESE CHANGES ALONE ARE ESTIMATED TO INCREASE AVERAGE FAMILY INCOME BY MORE THAN $4 ,000. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ALSO RECEIVED A MASSIVE TAX CUT AND CAN NOW DEDUCT 20% OF THEIR BUSINESS INCOME. HERE TONIGHT ARE STEVE STOUT AND SANDY KEPLINGER OF STOUT MANUFACTURING, A SMALL, BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS IN OHIO. THEY'VE JUST FINISHED THE BEST YEAR IN THEIR 20-YEAR HISTORY.  BECAUSE OF TAX REFORM THEY ARE HANDING OUT RAISES, HIRING AN ADDITIONAL 14 PEOPLE, AND EXPANDING INTO THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR. GOOD FEELING.  OF STAUB'S EMPLOYEES, COREY ADAMS, IS ALSO WITH US TONIGHT. COREY IS AN ALL-AMERICAN WORKER. HE SUPPORTED HIMSELF THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, LOST HIS JOB DURING THE 2008 RECESSION, AND WAS LATER HIRED BY STAUB, WHERE HE TRAINED TO BECOME A WELDER. LIKE MANY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS, COREY PLANS TO INVEST HIS TAX-CUT RAISE INTO HIS NEW HOME AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS' EDUCATION. COREY, PLEASE STAND.   AND HE'S A GREAT WELDER. I WAS TOLD THAT BY THE MAN THAT OWNS THAT COMPANY THAT'S DOING SO WELL, SO CONGRATULATIONS, COREY. SINCE WE PASSED TAX CUTS, ROUGHLY THREE MILLION WORKERS HAVE ALREADY GOT TAX-CUT BONUSES, MANY OF THEM THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER WORKER. IT'S GETTING MORE EVERY MONTH, EVERY WEEK. AN PAL HAS JUST ANNOUNCED IT PLANS TO INVEST A TOTAL OF $350 BILLION IN AMERICA AND HIRE ANOTHER 20,000 WORKERS.  AND JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO EXXON-MOBIL ANNOUNCED A $50 BILLION INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO.  THIS, IN FACT, IS OUR NEW AMERICAN MOMENT. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO START LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM. SO TO EVERY CITIZEN WATCHING AT HOME TONIGHT, NO MATTER WHERE YOU'VE BEEN OR WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM, THIS IS YOUR TIME. IF YOU WORK HARD, IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, IF YOU BELIEVE IN AMERICA, THEN YOU CAN DREAM ANYTHING, YOU CAN BE ANYTHING, AND TOGETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING.  TONIGHT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AND WHAT KIND OF A NATION WE'RE GOING TO BE. ALL OF US TOGETHER AS ONE TEAM, ONE PEOPLE, AND ONE AMERICAN FAMILY CAN DO ANYTHING. WE ALL SHARE THE SAME HOME, THE SAME HEART, THE SAME DESTINY, AND THE SAME GREAT AMERICAN FLAG.  TOGETHER WE ARE REDISCOVERING THE AMERICAN WAY. IN AMERICA WE KNOW THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE CENTER OF AMERICAN LIFE. THE MOTTO IS: IN GOD WE TRUST.  AND WE CELEBRATE OUR POLICE, OUR MILITARY, AND OUR AMAZING VETERANS AS HEROES WHO DESERVE OUR TOTAL AND UNWAVERING SUPPORT.  HERE TONIGHT IS PRESTON SHARP, A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY FROM REDDING, CALIFORNIA, WHO NOTICED THAT VETERANS' GRAVES WERE NOT MARKED WITH FLAGS ON VETERANS DAY. HE DECIDED ALL BY HIMSELF TO CHANGE THAT AND STARTED A MOVEMENT. THAT HAS NOW PLACED 40,000 FLAGS AT THE GRAVES OF OUR GREAT HEROES. PRESTON, A JOB WELL DONE.   YOUNG PATRIOTS LIKE PESTON TEACH ALL OF US ABOUT OUR CIVIC DUTY AS AMERICANS, AND I MET PRESTON A LITTLE WHILE AGO, AND HE IS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. GREAT FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE, PRESTON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  PRESTON'S REVERENCE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED OUR NATION REMINDS US OF WHY WE SALUTE OUR FLAG, WHY WE PUT OUR HANDS ON OUR HEARTS FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, AND WHY WE PROUDLY STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.   AMERICANS LOVE THEIR COUNTRY, AND THEY DESERVE A GOVERNMENT THAT SHOWS THEM THE SAME LOVE AND LOYALTY IN RETURN. FOR THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO RESTORE THE BONDS OF TRUST BETWEEN OUR CITIZENS AND THEIR GOVERNMENT. WORKING WITH THE SENATE, WE ARE APPOINTING JUDGES WHO WILL INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN, INCLUDING A GREAT NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND MORE CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES THAN ANY NEW ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE TOTALLY DEFENDING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT AND HAVE TAKEN HISTORIC ACTIONS TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.   SERVING OUR BRAVE VETERANS, INCLUDING GIVING OUR VETERANS CHOICE IN THEIR HEALTHCARE DECISIONS.   LAST YEAR CONGRESS ALSO PASSED AND I SIGNED THE LANDMARK V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.  SINCE ITS PASSAGE, MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY REMOVED MORE THAN 1,500 V.A. EMPLOYEES WHO FAILED TO GIVE OUR VETERANS THE CARE THEY DESERVE, AND WE ARE HIRING TALENTED PEOPLE WHO LOVE OUR VETS AS MUCH AS WE DO.   AND I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL OUR VETERANS ARE PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF, WHICH HAS BEEN MY PROMISE TO THEM FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS GREAT JOURNEY.  ALL AMERICANS DESERVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPECT, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GIVING TO OUR WONDERFUL HEROES, OUR VETERANS. THANK YOU.  SO TONIGHT I CALL ON CONGRESS TO EMPOWER EVERY CABINET SECRETARY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO REWARD GOOD WORKERS AND TOO REMOVE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES WHO UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC TRUST OR FAIL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.   IN OUR DRIVE TO MAKE WASHINGTON ACCOUNTABLE, WE HAVE ELIMINATED MORE REGULATIONS IN OUR FIRST YEAR THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY, AND WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL.  WE ARE NOW VERY PROUDLY AN EXPORTER OF ENERGY TO THE WORLD.  IN DETROIT I HALTED GOVERNMENT MANDATES THAT CRIPPLED AMERICA'S GREAT, BEAUTIFUL AUTOWORKERS SO THAT WE CAN GET MOTOR CITY REV REVVING ITS ENGINES AGAIN, AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.  MANY CAR COMPANIES ARE NOW BUILDING AND EXPLAIDING PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES, SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT SEEN FOR DECADES. CHRYSLER IS MOVING A MAJOR PLANT FROM MEXICO TO MICHIGAN. TOYOTA AND MAZDA ARE OPENING UP A PLANT IN ALABAMA, A BIG ONE, AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN A LONG TIME. IT'S ALL COMING BACK.  VERY SOON AUTO PLANTS AND OTHER PLANTS WILL BE OPENING UP ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS ALL NEWS AMERICANS ARE TOTALLY UNACCUSTOMED TO HEARING. FOR MANY YEARS COMPANIES AND JOBS WERE ONLY LEAVING US, BUT NOW THEY ARE ROARING BACK. THEY'RE COMING BACK. THEY WANT TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS. THEY WANT TO BE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT'S WHERE THEY WANT TO BE.  EXCITING PROGRESS IS HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY. TO SPEED ACCESS, TO BREAKTHROUGH CURES AND AFFORDABLE DRUGS, LAST YEAR THE F.D.A. APPROVED MORE NEW AND GENERIC DRUGS AND MEDICAL DEVICES THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PATIENTS WITH TERMINAL CONDITIONS, TERMINAL ILLNESS, SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE THEIR LIVES. PEOPLE WHO ARE TERMINALLY ILL SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY TO SEEK A CURE. I WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE RIGHT HERE AT HOME. IT'S TIME FOR CONGRESS TO GIVE THESE WONDERFUL, INCREDIBLE AMERICANS THE RIGHT TO TRY.  ONE OF MY GREATEST PRIORITIES IS TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.  IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES THESE DRUGS COST FAR LESS THAN WHAT WE PAY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND IT'S VERY, VERY UNFAIR. THAT IS WHY I HAVE DIRECTED MY ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE FIXING THE INJUSTICE OF HIGH DRUG PRICES ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE YEAR. AND PRICES WILL COME DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY. WATCH. AMERICA HAS ALSO FINALLY TURNED THE PAGE ON DECADES OF UNFAIR TRADE DEALS THAT SACRIFICED OUR PROSPERITY AND SHIPPED AWAY OUR COMPANIES, OUR JOBS, AND OUR WEALTH. OUR NATION HAS LOST ITS WEALTH, BUT WE'RE GETTING IT BACK SO FAST. THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS TOTALLY OVER. FROM NOW ON WE EXPECT TRADING RELATIONSHIPS TO BE FAIR AND VERY IMPORTANTLY RECIPROCAL. WE WILL WORK TO FIX BAD TRADE DEALS AND NEGOTIATE NEW ONES, AND THEY WILL BE GOOD ONE, BUT THEY WILL BE FAIR, AND WE WILL PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THROUGH STRONG ENFORCEMENT OF OUR TRADE RULES.  AS WE REBUILD OUR INDUSTRIES, IT IS ALSO TIME TO REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE.  AMERICA IS A NATION OF BUILDERS. WE BUILT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING IN JUST ONE YEAR. ISN'T IT A DISGRACE THAT IT CAN NOW TAKE TEN YEARS JUST TO GET A MINOR PERMIT APPROVED FOR THE BUILDING OF A SIMPLE ROAD?  I AM ASKING BOTH PARTIES TO COME TOGETHER TO GIVE US SAFE, FAST, RELIABLE, AND MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT OUR ECONOMY NEEDS AND OUR PEOPLE DESERVE.  TONIGHT I'M CALLING ON CONGRESS TO PRODUCE A BILL THAT GENERATES AT LEAST $1.5 TRILLION FOR THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT OUR COUNTRY SO DESPERATELY NEEDS. EVERY FEDERAL DOLLAR SHOULD BE LEVERAGED BY PARTNERING WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, TAPPING INTO PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT TO PERMANENTLY FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT. AND WE CAN DO IT.  ANY BILL MUST ALSO STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING AND APPROVAL PROCESS, GETTING IT DOWN TO NO MORE THAN TWO YEARS AND PERHAPS EVEN ONE. TOGETHER WE CAN RECLAIM OUR GREAT BUILDING HERITAGE. WE WILL BUILD GLEAMING NEW ROADS, BRIDGE, HIGHWAY, RAILWAYS, AND WATERWAYS ALL ACROSS OUR LAND, AND WE WILL DO IT WITH AMERICAN HEART, AMERICAN HANDS, AND AMERICAN GRIT.  WE WANT EVERY AMERICAN TO KNOW THE DIGNITY OF A HARD DAY'S WORK. WE WANT EVERY CHILD TO BE SAFE IN THEIR HOME AT NIGHT. AND WE WANT EVERY CITIZEN TO BE PROUD OF THIS LAND THAT WE ALL LOVE SO MUCH. WE CAN LIFT OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE, AND FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY.çó  AS TAX CUTS CREATE NEW JOBS, LET'S INVEST IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND LET'S INVEST IN JOB TRAINING, WHICH WE NEED SO BADLY.  LET'S OPEN GREAT VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS SO OUR FUTURE WORKERS CAN LEARN A CRAFT AND REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.  AND LET'S SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES BY SUPPORTING PAID FAMILY LEAVE.  AS AMERICA REGAINS ITS STRENGTH, OPPORTUNITY MUST BE EXTENDED TO ALL CITIZENS. THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR WE WILL EMBARK ON REFORMING OUR PRISONS TO HELP FORMER INMATES WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME GET A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE.  STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY, WILL ALSO BE HELPED BY IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT FOCUS ON THE BEST INTERESTS OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. FOR DECADES OPEN BORDERS HAVE ALLOWED DRUGS AND GANGS TO POUR INTO OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THEY HAVE ALLOWED MILLIONS OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS TO COMPETE FOR JOBS AND WAGES AGAINST THE POOREST AMERICANS. MOST TRAGICALLY, THEY HAVE CAUSED THE LOSS OF MANY INNOCENT LIVES. HERE TONIGHT ARE TWO FATHERS AND TWO MOTHERS, EVELYN RODRIGUEZ, FREDDY CUEVAS, ELIZABETH ALVARADO, AND ROBERT MICKENS. THEIR TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, KAYLA CUEVAS AND NEESA MICKENS, WERE CLOSE FRIENDS ON LONG ISLAND, BUT IN SEPTEMBER 2016, ON THE EVE OF NEESA'S 16th BIRTHDAY, SUCH A HAPPY TIME IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, NEITHER OF THEM CAME HOME. THESE TWO PRECIOUS GIRLS WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED WHILE WALKING TOGETHER IN THEIR HOMETOWN. SIX MEMBERS OF THE SAVAGE MS-13 GANG HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH KAYLA AND NEESA'S MURDERS. MANY OF THESE GANG MEMBERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF GLARING LOOPHOLES IN OUR LAWS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY AS ILLEGAL, UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN MINORS AND WOUND UP IN KAYLA AND NEESA'S HIGH SCHOOL. EVELYN, LIZ BEST, FREDDY AND ROBERT, TONIGHT EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER IS PRAYING FOR YOU. EVERYONE IN AMERICA IS GRIEVING FOR YOU. PLEASE STAND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.    I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT 320 MILLION HEARTS ARE RIGHT NOW BREAKING FOR YOU. WE LOVE YOU. THANK YOU.  WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE DEPTHS OF THAT KIND OF SORROW, BUT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OTHER FAMILIES NEVER HAVE TO ENDURE THIS KIND OF PAIN. TONIGHT I AM CALLING ON CONGRESS TO FINALLY CLOSE THE DEADLY LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE ALLOWED MS-13 AND OTHER CRIMINAL GANGS TO BREAK INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE PROPOSED NEW LEGISLATION THAT WILL FIX OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS AND SUPPORT OUR ICE AND BORDER PATROL AGENTS. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE THAT WORK SO HARD IN THE MIDST OF SUCH DANGER SO THAT THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.  THE UNITED STATES IS A COMPASSIONATE NATION. WE ARE PROUD THAT WE DO MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TO HELP THE NEEDY, THE STRUGGLING, AND THE UNDERPRIVILEGED ALL OVER THE WORLD. BUT AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MY HIGHEST LOYALTY, MY GREATEST COMPASSION, MY CONSTANT CONCERN IS FOR AMERICA'S CHILDREN, AMERICA'S STRUGGLING WORKERS, AND AMERICA'S FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES. I WANT OUR YOUTH TO GROW UP TO ACHIEVE GREAT THINGS. I WANT OUR POOR TO HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO RISE. SO TONIGHT I AM EXTENDING AN OPEN HAND TO WORK WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS OF EVERY BACKGROUND, COLOR, RELIGION, AND CREED.  MY DUTY AND THE SACRED DUTY OF EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THIS CHAMBER IS TO DEFEND AMERICANS, TO PROTECT THEIR SAFETY, THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND THEIR RIGHT TO THE AMERICAN DREAM, BECAUSE AMERICANS ARE DREAMERS, TOO.   HERE TONIGHT IS ONE LEADER IN THE EFFORT TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY, HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS SPECIAL AGENT CELESTINO MARTINEZ. HE GOES BY D.J. AND C.J. HE SAID CALL ME EITHER ONE. SO WE'LL CALL YOU C.J. SIR, 15 YEARS IN THE AIR FORCE BEFORE BECOMING AN ICE AGENT AND SPENDING THE LAST 15 YEARS FIGHTING GANG VIOLENCE AND GETTING DANGEROUS CRIMINALS OFF OF OUR STREETS. TOUGH JOB. AT ONE POINT MS-13 LEADERS ORDERED C.J.'S MURDER, AND THEY WANTED IT TO HAPPEN QUICKLY, BUT HE DID NOT CAVE TO THREATS OR TO FEAR. LAST MAY HE COMMANDED AN OPERATION TO TRACK DOWN GANG MEMBERS ON LONG ISLAND. HIS TEAM HAS ARRESTED NEARLY 400, INCLUDING MORE THAN 220MS-13 GANG MEMBERS. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHAT THE BORDER PATROL AND ICE HAVE DONE, WE HAVE SENT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MS-13 HORRIBLE PEOPLE OUT OF THIS COUNTRY OR INTO OUR PRISONS. SO I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU, C.J. YOU'RE A BRAVE GUY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.   AND I ASKED C.J., WHAT'S THE SECRET? HE SAID, ""WE'RE JUST TOUGHER THAN THEY ARE,"" AND I LIKE THAT ANSWER. NOW LET'S GET CONGRESS TO SEND YOU AND AWE OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS GREAT CHAMBER HAVE TO DO IT, WE HAVE NO CHOICE, C.J., WE'RE GOING TO SEND YOU REINFORCEMENTS, AND WE'RE GOING TO SEND THEM TO YOU QUICKLY. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED.  OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THE HOUSE AND SENATE WILL BE VOTING ON AN IMMIGRATION REFORM PACKAGE. IN RECENT MONTHS MY ADMINISTRATION HAS MET EXTENSIVELY WITH BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO CRAFT A BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION REFORM. BASED ON THESE DISCUSSIONS, WE PRESENTED CONGRESS WITH A DETAILED PROPOSAL THAT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY BOTH PARTIES AS A FAIR COMPROMISE, ONE WHERE NOBODY GETS EVERYTHING THEY WANT BUT WHERE OUR COUNTRY GETS THE CRITICAL REFORMS IT NEEDS AND MUST HAVE.  HERE ARE THE FOUR PILLARS OF OUR PLAN: THE FIRST PILLAR OF OUR FRAMEWORK GENERALLY IS -- GENEROUSLY OFFERS A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR 1.8 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO WERE BROUGHT HERE BY THEIR PARENTS AT A YOUNG AGE. THAT COVERS ALMOST THREE TIMES MORE PEOPLE THAN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION COVERED. UNDER OUR PLAN THOSE WHO MEET EDUCATION AND WORK REQUIREMENTS AND SHOW GOOD MORAL CHARACTER WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME FULL CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OVER A 12-YEAR PERIOD. THE SECOND PILLAR FULLY SECURITIES THE BORDER.  MEANS BUILDING A GREAT WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND IT MEANS HIRING MORE HEROES LIKE C.J. TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE.  CRUCIALLY OUR PLAN CLOSES THE TERRIBLE LOOPHOLES EXPLOITED BY TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS TO ENTER OUR COUNTRY, AND IT FINALLY ENDS THE HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS PRACTICE OF CATCH AND RELEASE.  THE VISA LOTTERY, A PROGRAM THAT RANDOMLY HANDS OUT GREEN CARDS WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR SKILL, MERIT, OR THE SAFETY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE.  IT'S TIME TO BEGIN MOVING TOWARD A MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, ONE THAT ADMITS PEOPLE WHO ARE SKILLED, WHO WANT TO WORK, WHO WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY, AND WHO WILL LOVE AND RESPECT OUR COUNTRY.  THE FOURTH AND FINAL PILLAR PROTECTS THE NUCLEAR FAMILY BY ENDING CHAIN MIGRATION.  UNDER THE CURRENT BROKEN SYSTEM, A SINGLE IMMIGRANT CAN BRING IN VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF DISTANT RELATIVES. UNDER OUR PLAN, WE FOCUS ON THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY BY LIMITING SPONSORSHIPS TO SPOUSES AND MINOR CHILDREN.  THIS VITAL REFORM IS NECESSARY, NOT JUST FOR OUR ECONOMY, BUT FOR OUR SECURITY AND FOR THE FUTURE OF AMERICA. IN RECENT WEEKS, TWO TERRORIST ATTACKS IN NEW YORK WERE MADE POSSIBLE BY THE VISA LOTTERY AND CHAIN MIGRATION. IN THE AGE OF TERRORISM, THESE PROGRAMS PRESENT RISKS. WE CAN JUST NO LONGER AFFORD. IT'S TIME TO REFORM--  -- THESE OUTDATED IMMIGRATION RULES, AND FINALLY BRING OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM INTO THE 21st CENTURY.  THESE FOUR PILLARS REPRESENT A DOWN-THE-MIDDLE COMPROMISE, AND ONE THAT WILL CREATE A SAFE, MODERN, AND LAWFUL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. FOR OVER 30 YEARS, WASHINGTON HAS TRIED AND FAILED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THIS CONGRESS CAN BE THE ONE THAT FINALLY MAKES IT HAPPEN. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THESE FOUR PILLARS WILL PRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT FULFILLS MY IRONCLAD PLEDGE TO SIGN A BILL THAT PUTS AMERICA FIRST.  SO LET'S COME TOGETHER, SET POLITICS ASIDE, AND FINALLY GET THE JOB DONE.  THESE REFORMS WILL ALSO SUPPORT OUR RESPONSE TO THE TERRIBLE CRISIS OF OPIOID AND DRUG ADDICTION. NEVER BEFORE HAS IT BEEN LIKE IT IS NOW. IT IS TERRIBLE. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IN 2016, WE LOST 64,000 AMERICANS TO DRUG OVERDOSES, 174 DEATHS PER DAY, SEVEN PER HOUR. WE MUST GET MUCH TOUGHER ON DRUG DEALERS AND PUSHERS IF WE ARE GOING TO SUCCEED IN STOPPING THIS SCOURGE.  MY ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO FIGHTING THE DRUG EPIDEMIC AND HELPING GET TREATMENT FOR THOSE IN NEED, FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SO TERRIBLY HURT. THE STRUGGLE WILL BE LONG, AND IT WILL BE DIFFICULT, BUT AS AMERICANS ALWAYS DO, IN THE END, WE WILL SUCCEED. WE WILL PREVAIL.  AS WE HAVE SEEN TONIGHT, THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES BRING OUT THE BEST IN AMERICA. WE SEE A VIVID EXPRESSION OF THIS TRUTH IN THE STORY OF THE HOLETS FAMILY OF NEW MEXICO. RYAN HOLETS IS 27 YEARS OLD, AN OFFICER WITH THE ALBUQUERQUE POLICE DEPARTMENT. HE'S HERE TONIGHT WITH HIS WIFE, REBECCA.   THANK YOU, RYAN. LAST YEAR, RYAN WAS ON DUTY WHEN HE SAW A PREGNANT HOMELESS WOMAN PREPARING TO INJECT HEROIN. WHEN RYAN TOLD HER SHE WAS GOING TO HARM HER UNBORN CHILD, SHE BEGAN TO WEEP. SHE TOLD HIM SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN, BUT BADLY WANTED A SAFE HOME FOR HER BABY. AND THAT MOMENT, RYAN SAID HE FELT GOD SPEAK TO HIM ""YOU WILL DO IF BECAUSE YOU CAN."" HE HEARD THOSE WORDS. HE TOOK OUT A PICTURE OF HIS WIFE AND FOUR KIDS. THEN HE WENT HOME TO TELL HIS WIFE, REBECCA, IN AN INSTANT, SHE AGREED TO ADOPT. THE HOLETS NAMED THEIR NEW DAUGHTER HOPE. RYAN AND REBECCA, YOU EMBODY THE GOODNESS OF OUR NATION. THANK YOU.   THANK YOU, RYAN AND REBECCA. AS WE REBUILD AMERICA'S STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE AT HOME, WE ARE ALSO RESTORING OUR STRENGTH AND STANDING ABROAD. AROUND THE WORLD, WE FACE ROGUE REGIMES, TERRORIST GROUPS, AND RIVALS LIKE CHINA AND RUSSIA THAT CHALLENGE OUR INTERESTS, OUR ECONOMY, AND OUR VALUES. IN CONFRONTING THESE HORRIBLE DANGERS, WE KNOW THAT WEAKNESS IS THE SUREST PATH TO CONFLICT, AND UNMATCHED POWER IS THE SUREST MEANS TO OUR TRUE AND GREAT DEFENSE. FOR THIS REASON, I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO END THE DANGEROUS DEFENSE SEQUESTER AND FULLY FUND OUR GREAT MILITARY. . AS PART OF OUR DEFENSE, WE MUST MODERNIZE AND REBUILD OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL, HOPEFULLY NEVER HAVING TO USE IT, BUT MAKING IT SO STRONG AND SO POWERFUL THAT IT DETER ANY ACTS OF AGGRESSION BY ANY OTHER NATION OR ANYONE ELSE.  PERHAPS SOME DAY IN THE FUTURE, THERE WILL BE A MAGICAL MOMENT WHEN THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD WILL GET TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOT THERE YET. YET, SADLY. LAST YEAR, I ALSO PLEDGED THAT WE WOULD WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO EXTINGUISH ISIS FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. ONE YEAR LATER, I AM PROUD TO REPORT THAT THE COALITION TO DEFEAT ISIS HAS LIBERATED VERY CLOSE TO 100% OF THE TERRITORY JUST RECENTLY HELD BY THESE KILLERS IN IRAQ AND IN SYRIA AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS AS WELL.  BUT THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR FIGHT UNTIL ISIS IS DEFEATED. ARMY STAFF SERGEANT JUSTIN PECK IS HERE TONIGHT. NEAR RAQQA LAST NOVEMBER, JUSTIN AND HIS COMRADE, CHIEF PETTY OFFICER KENTON STACY, WERE ON A MISSION TO CLEAR BUILDINGS THAT ISIS HAD RIGGED WITH EXPLOSIVE SO THAT CIVILIANS COULD RETURN TO THAT CITY, HOPEFULLY SOON, AND HOPEFULLY SAFELY. CLEARING THE SECOND FLOOR OF A VITAL HOSPITAL, KENTON STACY WAS SEVERELY WOUNDED BY AN EXPLOSIO EXPLOSION. IMMEDIATELY, JUSTIN BOUNDED INTO THE BOOBY-TRAPPED AND UNBELIEVABLY DANGEROUS AND UNSAFE BUILDING AND FOUND KENTON, BUT IN VERY, VERY BAD SHAPE. HE APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE WOUND AND INSERTED A TUBE TO REOPEN AN AIRWAY. HE THEN PERFORMED CPR FOR 20 STRAIGHT MINUTES DURING THE GROUND TRANSPORT AND MAINTAINED ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION THROUGH 2.5 HOURS, AND THROUGH EMERGENCY SURGERY. KENTON STACY WOULD HAVE DIED IF IT WERE NOT FOR JUSTIN'S SELF-LESS LOVE FOR HIS FELLOW WARRIOR. TONIGHT, KENTON IS RECOVERING IN TEXAS. RAQQA IS LIBERATED. AND JUSTIN IS WEARING HIS NEW BRONZE STAR WITH A ""V"" FOR VALOR. STAFF SERGEANT PECK, ALL OF AMERICA SALUTES YOU.   TERRORISTS WHO DO THINGS LIKE PLACE BOMBS IN CIVILIAN HOSPITALS ARE EVIL. WHEN POSSIBLE, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ANNIHILATE THEM. WHEN NECESSARY, WE MUST BE ABLE TO DETAIN AND QUESTION THEM. BUT WE MUST BE CLEAR: TERRORISTS ARE NOT MERELY CRIMINALS. THEY ARE UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANTS.  AND WHEN CAPTURED OVERSEAS, THEY SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THE TERRORISTS THEY ARE. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE FOOLISHLY RELEASED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DANGEROUS TERRORISTS, ONLY TO MEET THEM AGAIN ON THE BATTLEFIELD, INCLUDING THE ISIS LEADER, AL-BAGHDADI, WHO WE CAPTURED, WHO WE HAD, WHO WE RELEASED. SO TODAY, I'M KEEPING ANOTHER PROMISE. I JUST SIGNED, PRIOR TO WALKING IN, AN ORDER DIRECTING SECRETARY MATTIS, WHO IS DOING A GREAT JOB, THANK YOU.  TO REEXAMINE OUR MILITARY DETENTION POLICY AND TO KEEP OPEN THE DETENTION FACILITIES IN GUANTANAMO BAY.  I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO ENSURE THAT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS AND AL QAEDA WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ALL NECESSARY POWER TO DETAIN TERRORISTS WHEREVER WE CHASE THEM DOWN, WHEREVER WE FIND THEM THEM. AND IN MANY CASES, FOR THEM IT WILL NOW BE GUANTANAMO BAY.  AT THE SAME TIME, AS OF A FEW MONTHS AGO, OUR WARRIORS IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE NEW RULES OF ENGAGEMENT.  ALONG WITH THEIR HEROIC AFGHAN PARTNERS, OUR MILITARY IS NO LONGER UNDERMIND BY ARTIFICIAL TIMELINES, AND WE NO LONGER TELL OUR ENEMIES OUR PLANS.  LAST MONTH, I ALSO TOOK AN ACTION ENDORSED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE U.S. SENATE JUST MONTHS BEFORE. I RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.  SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, DOZENS OF COUNTRIES VOTED IN THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AGAINST AMERICA'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO MAKE THIS DECISION. IN 2016, AMERICAN TAXPAYERS GENEROUSLY SENT THOSE SAME COUNTRIES MORE THAN $20 BILLION IN AID. THAT IS WHY TONIGHT, I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION TO HELP ENSURE AMERICAN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE DOLLARS ALWAYS SERVE AMERICAN INTERESTS, AND ONLY GO TO FRIENDS OF AMERICA, NOT ENEMIES OF AMERICA.  AS WE STRENGTHEN FRIENDSHIPS ALL AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE ALSO RESTORING CLARITY ABOUT OUR ADVERSARIES. WHEN THE PEOPLE OF IRAN ROSE UP AGAINST THE CRIMES OF THEIR CORRUPT DICTATORSHIP, I DID NOT STAY SILENT. AMERICA STANDS WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRAN IN THEIR COURAGEOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM.  I AM ASKING CONGRESS TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS IN THE TERRIBLE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO IMPOSED TOUGH SANCTIONS ON THE COMMUNIST AND SOCIALIST DICTATORSHIPS IN CUBA AND VENEZUELA.  BUT NO REGIME HAS OPPRESSED ITS OWN CITIZENS MORE TOTALLY OR BRUTALLY THAN THE CRUEL DICTATORSHIP IN NORTH KOREA. NORTH KOREA'S RECKLESS PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR MISSILES COULD VERY SOON THREATEN OUR HOMELAND. WE ARE WAGING A CAMPAIGN OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE TO PREVENT THAT FROM EVER HAPPENING. PAST EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US THAT COMPLACENCY AND CONCESSIONS ONLY INVITE AGGRESSION AND PROVOCATION. I WILL NOT REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF PAST ADMINISTRATIONS THAT GOT US INTO THIS VERY DANGEROUS POSITION. WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT THE DETRAIFED CHARACTER, DEPRAVED CHARACTER OF THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE NUCLEAR THREAT IT COULD POSE TO AMERICA AND TO OUR ALLIES. OTO WARMERE WAS A HARDWORKING STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND A GREAT STUDENT HE WAS. ON HIS WAY TO STUDY ABROAD IN ASIA, OTO JOINED A TOUR TO NORTH KOREA. AT ITS CONCLUSION, THIS WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH CRIMES AGAINST THE STATE. AFTER A SHAMEFUL TRIAL, THE DICTATORSHIP SENTENCED OTTO TO 15 YEARS OF HARD LABOR BEFORE RETURNING HIM TO AMERICA LAST JUNE HORRIBLY INJURED AND ON THE VERGE OF DEATH. HE PASSED AWAY JUST DAYS AFTER HIS RETURN. OTTO'S WONDERFUL PARENTS, FRED AND CINDY WARMBIER, ARE HERE TONIGHT ALONG WITH OTTO'S BROTHER AND SISTER, AUSTIN AND GRETA. PLEASE.  INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. YOU ARE POWERFUL WITNESSES TO A MENACE THAT THREATENS OUR WORLD, ASK YOUR STRENGTH TRULY INSPIRES US ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.  TONIGHT WE PLEDGE TO HONOR OTTO'S MEMORY WITH TOTAL AMERICAN RESOLVE. THANK YOU. FINALLY--  WE ARE JOINED BY ONE MORE WITNESS TO THE OMINOUS NATURE OF THIS REGIME. HIS NAME IS MR. JI SEONG-HO. IN 1996, HE WAS A STARVING BOY IN NORTH KOREA. ONE DAY HE TRIED TO STEAL COAL FROM A RAILROAD CAR TO BARTER FOR A FEW SCRAPS OF FOOD, WHICH WERE VERY HARD TO GET. IN THE PROCESS, HE PASSED OUT ON THE TRAIN TRACKS, EXHAUSTED FROM HUNGER. HE WOKE UP AS A TRAIN RAN OVER HIS LIMBS. HE THEN ENDURED MULTIPLE AMPUTATIONS WITHOUT ANYTHING TO DULL THE PAIN OR THE HURT. HIS BROTHER AND SISTER GAVE WHAT LITTLE FOOD THEY HAD TO HELP HIM RECOVER, AND ATE DIRT THEMSELVES, PERMANENTLY STUNTING THEIR OWN GROWTH. LATER, HE WAS TORTURED BY NORTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES AFTER RETURNING FROM A BRIEF VISIT TO CHINA. HIS TORMENTERS WANTED TO KNOW IF HE'D MET ANY CHRISTIANS. HE HAD, AND HE RESOLVED AFTER THAT TO BE FREE. SEIONG-HO TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES ON CRUTCHES ALL ACROSS CHINA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA TO FREEDOM. MOST OF HIS FAMILY FOLLOWED. HIS FATHER WAS CAUGHT TRYING TO ESCAPE AND WAS TORTURED TO DEATH. TODAY, HE LIVES IN SEOUL, WHERE HE RESCUES OTHER DEFECTORS AND BROADCASTS INTO NORTH KOREA WHAT THE REGIME FEARS MOST: THE TRUTH. TODAY, HE HAS A NEW LEG, BUT SEIONG-HO, I UNDERSTAND YOU STILL KEEP THOSE OLD CRUTCHES AS A REMINDER OF HOW FAR YOU'VE COME. YOUR GREAT SACRIFICE IS AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL. PLEASE, THANK YOU.  ( CHEERS ) SEOING-HO'S STORY IS THE TESTAMENT TO EVERY HUMAN SOUL TO LIVE IN FREEDOM. IT WAS THAT SAME YEARNING FOR FREEDOM THAT NEARLY 250 YEARS AGO GAVE BIRTH TO A SPECIAL PLACE CALLED AMERICA. IT WAS A SMALL CLUSTER OF COLONIES CAUGHT BETWEEN A GREAT OCEAN AND A VAST WILDERNESS. IT WAS HOME TO AN INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WITH A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA IDEA, THAT THEY COULD RULE THEMSELVES. THAT THEY COULD CHART THEIR OWN DESTINY, AND THAT TOGETHER, THEY COULD LIGHT UP THE ENTIRE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS STOOD FOR, ALWAYS STRIVED FOR, AND ALWAYS DONE. ATOP THE DOME OF THIS CAPITOL STANDS THE STATUE OF FREEDOM. SHE STANDS TALL AND DIGNIFIED AMONG THE MONUMENTS TO OUR ANCESTORS WHO FOUGHT AND LIVED AND DIED TO PROTECT HER. MONUMENTS TO WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON AND LINCOLN AND KING, MEMORIALS TO THE HEROES OF YORKTOWN, AND SARATOGA. TO YOUNG AMERICANS WHO SHED THEIR BLOOD ON THE SHORES OF NORMANDY AND THE FIELDS BEYOND, AND OTHERS WHO WENT DOWN IN THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC AND THE SKIES ALL OVER ASIA. AND FREEDOM STANDS TALL OVER ONE MORE MONUMENT-- THIS ONE. THIS CAPITOL. THIS LIVING MONUMENT. THIS IS THE MONUMENT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! WE'RE A PEOPLE WHOSE HEROES LIVE NOT ONLY NEWSC PAST BUT ALL AROUND US, DEFENDING HOPE, PRIDE, AND DEFENDING THE AMERICAN WAY. THEY WORK IN EVERY TRADE. THEY SACRIFICE TO RAISE A FAMILY. THEY CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN AT HOME. THEY DEFEND OUR FLAG ABROAD. AND THEY ARE STRONG MOMS AND BRAVE KIDS. THEY ARE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND BORDER AGENTS, MEDICS AND MARINES. BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE, THEY ARE AMERICANS, AND THIS CAPITOL, THIS CITY, THIS NATION BELONGS ENTIRELY TO THEM.  OUR TASK IS TO RESPECT THEM, TO LISTEN TO THEM, TO SERVE THEM, TO PROTECT THEM, AND TO ALWAYS BE WORTHY OF THEM. AMERICANS FILL THE WORLD WITH ART AND MUSIC. THEY PUSH THE BOUNDS OF SCIENCE AND DISCOVERY, AND THEY FOREVER REMIND US OF WHAT WE SHOULD NEVER, EVER FORGET. THE PEOPLE DREAMED THIS COUNTRY. THE PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY, AND IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  AS LONG AS WE ARE PROUD OF WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR, THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT ACHIEVE AS LONG AS WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR VALUES, FAITH IN OUR CITIZENS, AND TRUST IN OUR GOD, WE WILL NEVER FAIL. OUR FAMILIES WILL THRIVE. OUR PEOPLE WILL PROSPER. AND OUR NATION WILL FOREVER BE SAFE AND STRONG AND PROUD AND MIGHTY AND FREE. THANK YOU, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. GOOD NIGHT.",First State of the Union Address,2018/1/31,Youtube
