1,David Atenbourough,your excellencies delegates ladies and gentlemen as you spend the next two weeks debating negotiating persuading and compromising as you surely must it's easy to forget that ultimately the emergency climate comes down to a single number the concentration of carbon in our atmosphere the measure that greatly determines global temperature and the changes in that one number is the clearest way to chart our own story for it defines our relationship with our world for much of humanity's ancient history that number bounced wildly between 180 and 300 and so too did global temperatures it was a brutal and unpredictable world at times our ancestors existed only in tiny numbers but just over 10 000 years ago that number suddenly stabilized and with it earth's climate we found ourselves in an unusually benign period with predictable seasons and reliable weather for the first time civilization was possible and we wasted no time in taking advantage of that everything we've achieved in the last 10 000 years was enabled by the stability during this time the global temperature has not wavered over this period by more than plus or minus one degree celsius until now our burning of fossil fuels our destruction of nature our approach to industry construction and learning are releasing carbon into the atmosphere at an unprecedented pace and scale we are already in trouble the stability we all depend on is breaking this story is one of inequality as well as instability today those who've done the least to cause this problem are being the hardest hit ultimately all of us will feel the impact some of which are now unavoidable my world is melting you think you have control we actually have no control i'm absolutely terrified to bring a child to this world is this how our story is due to end a tale of the smartest species doomed by that all-too-human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals perhaps the fact that the people most affected by climate change are no longer some imagined future generations but young people alive today perhaps that will give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story to turn this tragedy into a triumph we are after all the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on earth we now understand this problem we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse we must recapture billions of tons of carbon from the air we must fix our sites on keeping one and a half degrees within reach a new industrial revolution powered by millions of sustainable innovations is essential and is indeed already beginning we will all share in the benefits affordable clean energy healthy air and enough food to sustain us all nature is a key ally whenever we restore the wild it will recapture carbon and help us bring back balance to our planet and as we work to build a better world we must acknowledge no nation has completed its development because no advanced nation that is yet sustainable all have a journey still to compete so that all nations have a good standard of living and a modest footprint we're going to have to learn together how to achieve this ensuring none are left behind we must use this opportunity to create a more equal world and our motivation should not be fear but hope can we fix climate problem in one generation my answer would be yes we have to we need to not just to talk about what we can do but to do what we can this is a challenge that we should try to solve in a quick way with the long-term vision it comes down to this the people alive now the generation to come will look at this conference and consider one thing did that number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here there's every reason to believe that the answer can be yes if working apart we are force powerful enough to destabilize our planet surely working together we are powerful enough to save it in my lifetime i've witnessed a terrible decline in yours you could and should witness a wonderful recovery that desperate hope ladies and gentlemen delegates excellency it's why the world is looking to you and why you are here thank you you,COP 26,2021/11/2,Youtube
2,David Atenbourough, thank you Lisa your Royal Highnesses ladies and gentlemen there can surely be no more fitting location than this for the premiere of our planet directly behind me behind this enormous screen is a statue of Charles Darwin whose astonishing understanding of the natural world led to what has been called the greatest idea in human history the theory of evolution by natural selection Darwin revealed that all species have evolved over time to best exploit the conditions in which they live he further realized that these conditions are not simply those of geography and climate but also their relationship to other lives that live alongside from the delicate Co dependences of bees and orchids to the dramatic connection between cheetah and gazelle all life on Earth is both product and contributor to its place in space and time this complex web of life of which we are part has been millennia in the making whilst Darwin's insights explain how this web came about over 200 years later we are still only beginning to understand its interconnections and which of these connections are the most vital yet we do know for certain is that these connections can break from the dinosaurs to my right to other spectacular fossils on my left we have all tonight being within touching distance of astonishing fragments of ecosystems long gone as far as we know there have been five major extinction events on our planet events caused by changes so severe that many species simply can't adapt and as such die out right now we are in the midst of the Earth's sixth mass extinction one every bit as profound and far-reaching as that which wiped out the dinosaurs it's almost impossible to the grasp as we go about our lives that the rest of life on Earth is experiencing destruction on the scale of that brought by a colossal asteroid collision but consider these facts ninety-six percent of the mass of mammals on our planet today are us and the livestock that we've domesticated only four percent is everything else from elephants to badgers Tigers to bats seventy percent of all birds are now Temasek domesticated poultry mostly chickens nature once determined how we survive now we determine how nature survives one of the things Darwin's work has taught us is that we break nature's connections at our peril yet break them we do at ever greater speed the impacts of our growing population and our consumption now directly threaten our own future that magnificent creature up there whose skeletons hangs out there above us the blue whale can give us inspiration just thirty years ago most whale species including blue whale we're heading towards extinction a public outcry led to a global agreement to protect whales and now most populations are recovering we've subsequently learned how important whales are to the entire ocean system including the fish that we eat so saving these majestic creatures actually benefits us as well what we did to save the whales we must now do for all nature and that is a communications challenge as much as it is a scientific one the eight part our planet series aims to reach a billion people around the world it celebrates the species and habitats that still remain and reveals what must be protected to ensure both people and nature thrive I've always believed that few people will protect the natural world if they don't first love and understand it many sequences in the our planet series reveal nature at its most fascinating and delightful others prove that good things do indeed come to those who wait often further a very long time as the many talented cameramen and women who've recorded all kinds of wonders for us know only too well but what really makes our planet stand out is the clear driving story that runs through the entire species in star series and the wider communications project the natural world is not just nice to have it fundamentally matters to each and every one of us this has been a true labor of love for hundreds of filmmakers cinematographers conservationists editors we productions and teams all of whom have brought their best work to this most important story that there is a story that could not be more Universal or more timely the ability to tell that story in almost every country on earth at the same time via Netflix brings the possibility of an unprecedented global understanding of the one place that we all call home it's now my great privilege to hand over to someone whose father perhaps influenced him to spend much of his life experiencing and deeply understanding the natural world and whose passion and curiosity for the wonders of our planet has clearly inspired his next generation ladies and gentlemen please welcome the president of WWF UK His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales you,Our Planet Premiere,2019/4/5,Youtube
3,David Atenbourough, I'm very sorry I can't be with you all today and such an important gathering some have speculated that I've seen more of the natural world than anyone else well it's certainly true that I have been extremely fortunate to spend my life traveling the world to film and share the wonders of nature I've witnessed the natural world at its most fascinating and vibrant but I've also witnessed startling changes changes that are today threatening our various civilizations it's worth reflecting that our civilizations arose in a large part because of the last twelve thousand year period of climatic stability known as the Holocene which allowed humans to settle and farm this ability ultimately gave rise to international trade in ideas as well as goods making us the globally connected species we are today and in need of the International governance that you and your institutions provide however we've taken that stability for granted our economies and political systems are unconsciously predicated on the belief that nature will continue to be a benign and regular provider of the conditions we need to thrive regular seasons dependable fresh water endless fish pollinators minerals soil it's now apparent that the Holocene has ended and our stable reliable planet no longer exists the impacts of this destabilization will profoundly impact every country on Earth when you think about it there is perhaps no more unsettling thought the only conditions modern humans have ever known are changing and changing fast you are all in positions where you can make more of a difference than most if ever we needed a strong signal from world leaders from people like you that we're going to solve this it is now in 2020 we have a key moment in history some have called it a super year a coming together of major global decisions on climate nature oceans and development it could not be more important and far-reaching what we do in the next few years will determine the next few thousand years thank you for your leadership so far and I wish you every success in inspiring other world leaders to join you in this vital task,World Leaders at WWF’s Leaders for Nature and People event,2019/9/23,Youtube
4,David Atenbourough," fifty years ago on April the 29th a group of farsighted people in this country got together to warn the world of an impending disaster among them were a distinguished scientist Julian Huxley a bird loving painter Peter Scott an advertising executive Guy Mountford and a powerful and astonishingly effective civil servant max Nicholson and several others they were all in addition to their individual professions dedicated natural ists fascinated by the natural world not just in this country but internationally and they noticed what few others had done that all over the world charismatic animals that were once numerous were beginning to disappear the Arabian oryx which had once been widespread all over the peninsula had been reduced to a few hundred in Spain there were only about 90 Imperial Eagles left the Californian Condor was down to about 60 in Hawaii a goose that it once lived in flocks around the lava fields of the great volcanoes have been reduced to 50 and a strange little rhinoceros that lived in the dwindling forests of Java to about 40 these were the most extreme examples but whenever naturalist look they found that species of animals were population that were falling rapidly this planet was in danger of losing a significant number of its inhabitants both animals and plants something had to be done and that group determined to do it they would need scientific advice to discover the causes of these impending disasters and to devise ways of slowing them and hopefully stopping them they would have to raise awareness and understanding of people everywhere and I call such enterprises they would need money to enable them to take practical action and they set about raising all three since the problem was an international one they based themselves not here but in the heart of Europe in Switzerland and they called the organization they created the World Wildlife Fund as well as the International Committee several separate action groups were be needed in individual countries so a few months after that inaugural meeting in Switzerland this country established one and it was the first country to do so and you sir became its first president then after 20 years you became the international president of the entire organization which is known today as the World Wide Fund for Nature the method's WWF used to save these endangered species were several some like the Hawaiian goose and the Oryx were taken into captivity in zoos and bred up to into a significant population and then taken back to their original home and released elsewhere in Africa for example great areas of unspoiled country were set aside as national parks where the animals could be practicum poachers and encroaching human settlement in the Galapagos Islands and in the home of the Rwanda of the mountain gorillas in Rwanda ways were far too ensuring that local people who also had claims on the land where such animals lived were able to benefit financially by attracting visitors ecotourism was on the movement as a whole went from strength to strength 24 countries established their own WWF national appeals existing conservation bodies of which there were a number in many parts of the world but which had largely been working in arts isolation acquired new zest and international links new ones are founded focusing on particular areas or particular species the world awoke to conservation millions billions of dollars were raised and now 50 years on conservationists who've worked so hard and with such foresight can justifiably congratulate themselves on having responded magnificently to the challenge and yet now in spite of a great number of individual successes the problem seems bigger than ever true thanks to the vigor and wisdom of conservationists their major charismatic species has yet disappeared many are still crumbling on the big but they are hanging on today however overall there are more problems not less more species at risk of extinction than ever before why fifty years ago when the WWF was founded there were about 3 billion people on earth now they're almost 7 billion oh 4 twice as many and every one of them needing space space for the homeless space to grow their food or get others to grow it for them space to build schools and roads and airfields where did that come from a little might be taken from land occupied by other people but most of it could only come from the land which for millions of years animals and plants have had to themselves the natural world but the impact of these extra millions of people has spread far beyond the faith space that they physically claimed the spread of industrialization has changed the chemical consistency of the atmosphere the oceans that cover most of the surface of the planet have been polluted and increasingly acidified and the earth is warming we now realize that the disasters that continue increasingly to afflict the natural world have one element that connects them all the unprecedented increase in the number of human beings on the planet there had been profits of warned us of this impending disaster of course one of the first was Thomas Malthus his most important book an essay of the principle of population was published over 200 years ago in 1798 in it he argued that the human population would increase inexorably until it was halted by what he called misery and vice today for some reason that prophecy seems to be largely ignored or attenuate disregarded it's true that he did not foresee the so-called Green Revolution which greatly increased the amount of food that can be produced in any given area of arable land and there may be other advances in our food producing skills that we ourselves still can't foresee but such advances only delay things the fundamental truth that Malthus proclaimed remains the truth there cannot be more people on this earth than can be fed many people would like to deny that this is so they would like to believe in that oxymoron sustainable growth Kenneth Boulding President Kennedy's environmental adviser 45 years ago said something about this anyone who believes in indefinite growth in anything physical on a physically finite planet he said is either mad or an economist the population of the world is now growing by nearly 80 million a year one and a half million a week a quarter of a million a day 10,000 an hour growing in this country it's projected to grow by 10 million in the next 22 years all these people in this country and worldwide rich or poor need and deserve food water energy and space will they be able to get it I don't know I hope so you may have seen the government's foresight report on the future of food and farming it shows how hard it is to feed the seven billion of us who are alive today it is the many obstacles that are already making this harder to achieve soil erosion salinization the depletion of aquifers over grazing the speed of plant diseases as a result of globalization the absurd growing of food crops to turn into biofuels to feed motorcars instead of people and so on so it underlines how desperately difficult it's going to be to feed a population that is projected to stabilize in the range of 8 to 10 billion people by the year 2050 it recommends the widest possible range of measures across all disciplines to tackle this and it makes a number of eminently sensible recommendations including a second Green Revolution but surprisingly there are some things that the report does not say it doesn't state the obvious fact that it would be much easier to feed 8 billion people than 10 nor does it suggests that the measures to achieve such a number such as family planning and the education and empowerment of women should be a central part of any program that aims to secure an adequate food supply for you it doesn't refer to the prescient statement 40 years ago by Norman Borlaug the Nobel laureate and father of the first Green Revolution he produced new strains of high yielding short straw disease resistant wheat and in doing so saved thousands of people in India Pakistan Africa and Mexico from salvation but he warned us that all he had done was to give us a breathing space in which to stabilize our numbers the government's report anticipates that food prices may well rise with oil prices and makes it clear that this will affect poorest people worst and discusses various ways to help them but it doesn't mention what every mother subsisting on the equivalent of a dollar a day already knows that her children will be better fed if there were four of them around the table instead of ten these are strange omissions another impressive government report on biodiversity published this year making space for nature and a changing world is rather similar it discusses all the rising pressures on wildlife in the United Kingdom but it doesn't mention our growing population as being one of them which is particularly odd when you consider that Europe England rather is already the most densely populated country in Europe most bizarre of all was a recent report by a Royal Commission on the environmental impact of demographic change in this country which denied that population size was the problem at all as though 20 million extra people more or less would have no real impact of course it's not our only or even our main environmental problem but it's absurd to deny that as a multiplier of all the others it is a problem I suspect that you could read a score of reports by bodies concerned with global problems and see that population is clearly one of the drivers that underlies them all and yet find no reference this obvious fact in any of them climate change tops the environmental agenda at present we all know that every additional person will need to use some carbon energy if only for firewood for cooking and will therefore create more carbon dioxide now of course a rich person will produce vastly more than a poor man similarly we can all see that every extra person is or will an extra victim of climate change though the poor will undoubtedly suffer more than the rich yet not a word of it appeared in the voluminous Docklands emerging from the Copenhagen and Cancun climate summits why this strange silence I meet no one who privately disagrees that population growth is a problem no one except flat-earthers can deny that that planet is finite we can all see it in that beautiful picture from our earth of our earth taken from the Apollo mission it remains an obvious and brutal fact that on a finite planet human populations will quite definitely stop at some point and that can only happen in one of two ways it can happen sooner by fewer human births in a word by contraception that's the humane way the powerful option which allows all of us to deal with the problem if we collectively choose to do so the alternative is an increased death rate the way in which all other creatures must suffer through famine or disease or predation that translated into human terms means famine or disease or war over oil or water or food or minerals or grazing rights or just living space there is alas no third alternative of endeavor growth the sooner we stabilize our numbers the sooner we stop running up the down escalator stop population increase stop the escalator and we have some chance of reaching the top that's to say a decent life for all to do that requires several things first and foremost it needs a much wider understanding of the problem and that will not happen while the absurd taboo on discussing it remain such a powerful grip on the minds of so many otherwise worthy and intelligent people then it needs a change in our culture so that while everyone retains the right to have as many children as they'd like they understand that having large families means compounding the problems their children and everybody else's children will face in the future it needs action by governments in my view all countries should develop a population policy some 70 countries already have them in one form or another and give it priority the essential common factor is to make family planning and other reproductive health services freely available to everyone and empower and encourage them to use it though of course without any kind of coercion according to the global footprint Network there are already over a hundred countries whose combination of numbers and affluence have already pushed them past the sustainable level they include almost all developed countries this country is one of the worst they're the aim should be to reduce over time both the consumption of natural resources per person and the number of people while needless to say using the best technology to help maintain living standards it's tragic that the only current population policies in developed countries are perversely attempting to increase their birthrate in order to look after the growing number of old people the notion of ever more old people needing ever more young people who in turn will grow old and need ever more young people and so on ad infinitum is an obvious ecological Ponzi scheme I'm not an economist nor a sociologist nor a politician and it's from their disciplines that answers must come but I am a naturalist being one means that I do know something of the factors that keep populations of different species of animals within bounds and what happens when they don't thanks to our intelligence and our ever-increasing skills and sophisticated technologies we can avoid such brutalities we have medicines that prevent our children from dying of disease we develop ways of growing increasing amounts of food but we have removed the limiters that keep animal populations in check so now our destiny is in our hands there is one glimmer of hope wherever women have the vote wherever they are literate and have the medical facilities to control the number of children they bear the birth rate falls all those civilized conditions exist in the southern Indian state of Kerala in India as a whole the total fertility rate is 2.8 births per person per woman in Kerala it's 1.7 births per woman in Thailand last year it was 1.8 per woman similar to Kerala but compare that with the Catholic Philippines where it's 3.3 but what can each of us do you or I well there's just one thing I would ask the taboo in private and in public as best you can and as you judge right until it's broken here and it broken there is no hope of the action we need wherever and whenever we speak of the environment and a few words to ensure that the population element is not ignored if you're a member of a relevant NGO invite them to acknowledge it if you belong to a church and especially if you're a Catholic because its doctrine on contraception is a major factor in this problem suggest they consider the ethical issues involved if you have contacts in government ask why the growth of our population which affects every department is yet no one's responsibility big empty Australia has appointed a sustainable population Minister so why can't small crowded Britain the Hawaiian boost the aurochs the imperial eagle which sounded the environmental alarm fifty years ago where you might say the equivalent of Canaries in coal mines warnings of impending and even wider catastrophe every one of these global problems social as well as environmental becomes more difficult and ultimately impossible to solve with ever more people",People and Planet

5,David Atenbourough, over the course of my life i've encountered some of the world's most remarkable species of animals only now do i realize just how lucky i've been many of these wonders seem set to disappear forever the un panel of experts has found that one million animal and plant species face extinction it is worse than expected this is happening much faster than we've ever seen before today we are the asteroid that's causing many many species to go extinct simultaneously the evidence is that unless immediate action is taken this crisis has grave impacts for us all we're not just losing nice things to look at we're losing critical parts of earth's system and it's threatening our food our water our climate we are encroaching further and further every day into wildlife habitat and that drives emerging diseases if we carry on like this we will see more epidemics as bad as this and some of them could even be worse it's never been more critical for us to understand what is driving this crisis scientists have identified the key ways in which we humans are destroying the ecosystems on which we depend there are many ways to remove pieces of the puzzle the most obvious way is to kill something and we do a lot of that we're talking about millions of animals being snatched from the wild from thousands of species we have massive and widespread overfishing we're completely destroying the natural balance of fish in the world's oceans when i was a kid in the 1960s there were three billion people in the world and i'm now probably going to see it actually reach you know 9 billion in my lifetime which is pretty startling population growth is much much higher in the developing world than in the developed but it's problematic to just talk about population because there are two things which are going on it's population but it's also consumption and in terms of impact on the planet what's much more important is the growth in consumption levels and these are far higher in the developed economies while in a country like the united kingdom we have some very strong laws on how to reduce pollution we do have to realize we're no longer a major industrial country most of the things that we actually use are produced abroad in countries where the laws can be non-existent so we are simply moving our footprint on destroying nature to another country many people imagine there's this untouched wilderness because they see it on their tv screens but the reality is there's really not a lot of wild left out there we've converted 75 of the land that is not covered by eyes three quarters of the terrestrial surface has been changed a lot of it's just to feed one species all of the calculations show we're on track for a three to four degree world and the more the earth warms the worse the problem is there are lots of ways that climate change will impact on species these are no longer predictions we are seeing it happen those of us who care about the future of our planet you know we have to look at our lifestyles and we can't look away from our own behaviors 40 years ago people consumed a good deal less in the united kingdom but there is no evidence that we were unhappier then than we are now we can be more diligent about thinking about what we're consuming and when it's really digging down saying what's going on here where does that come from we need to think about meat and dairy consumption that's not to say that none of us should ever eat meat or should cut all dairy out of our diets but we have to demand that they are produced sustainably we also need to start producing affordable food without expanding any further into the forest this is indeed quite possible one of the biggest problems is incredible we actually waste about 40 percent of the food that is produced if we could reduce that food waste it would go a long long way to making a more sustainable agricultural system it's not just about our current lifestyle but about the education of our children on the way nature works if we don't act now the youth of today and the youth of tomorrow are going to look back on this generation with absolute horror what were you thinking we have a moment when we can change our world and make it better this is that moment i do truly believe that together we can create a better future i might not be here to see it but if we make the right decisions at this critical moment we can safeguard our planet's ecosystems its extraordinary biodiversity and all its inhabitants what happens next is up to every one of us you,"extinction crisis, David Attenborough - BBC",2020/9/23,Youtube
6,David Atenbourough," Earth in 4,500 million years our world has gone through many natural  changes now it's changing once again but this time we ourselves are contributing to those changes we are causing the world to heat up if we continue to behave as we are doing our children and grandchildren will have to deal with extreme and potentially catastrophic changes the vast forests of the Amazon could wither and burn the oceans could turn acid destroying much of the life they presently contain the Arctic could be transformed its ice could melt and its most famous animals vanish forever Rising Tides could cast millions of people a drift many of our coastal cities could be flooded and  drowned we still have time there are ways to minimize these changes if we all choose now to adopt them but the next few years will be crucial if we miss our chance the future may be Grim indeed for life on planet  Earth the great majority of scientists are now agree that our planet is warming and that human beings are at least some part of the reason it's doing so the questions now are what is going to happen and what can we do about  it we know there is now more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any time in the last 650,000 years carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas invisible and odorless it surrounds our planet warming it like a blanket and every year we add another 25 billion tons of it to the atmosphere as the blanket gets thicker the planet gets warmer but before that that was was the forecast for 2006 and this may well be the forecast in 2050 yes you're not hearing things 44 years from now and it will probably be another scorcher now temperatures in the early 21st century were record-breaking at 38 in London and 33 across Scotland more par for the course nowadays and quite a sultry night to come for many with temperatures just outside London no lower than 26° C and it's going to be followed by a scorcher of a day tomorrow again dry weather the heat continues so no relief from the drought in the southeast of England not great news for the garden as these longer growing seasons are not being matched by increased summer rainfall unfortunately the Midlands  still most of us relish the chance to soak up a little heat remember the summer of 2003   but that summer had a dark side tens of thousands of Europeans died in the heat while Summers like that are still rare the odds are that by the middle of this Century we'll get such a scorcher every other year and by the end of the century it will be so hot that a summer light 2003 will feel cold that sounds frightening is it really true we all would like to know for certain what will happen to our climate in the future whether we'll be sweltering in a heat wave or inundated by floods but scientists can only give us a range of possibilities and what they're telling us is that our world will warm anywhere between 1.4 and 5.8 de C in The Next Century to put it another way the impact of global warming will be somewhere between severe and catastrophic whether predictions of any kind are not easy but at the Met office's Hadley Center the forecasters have a particularly difficult problem and they're looking at what our climate might be like in a 100 years from now using a process called climate modeling I mean what we talking about 4 RA in places of climate models essentially have come out of weather forecasting models what they really do is they lay out a series of options based on what we do about climate change and it's up to us it's up to humankind to decide which of those paths to follow the modelers use one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe crunching 10 billion calculations every second it's like a flight simulator for the future climate they can ask it questions like what happens if we double our carbon dioxide emissions or how hot will it get overall it looks as if we are in for a bumpy   ride there many climate models across the world now they all for example agree that greenhouse gases are going to warm up the system and and buy similar  amounts no models are saying no climate change they're all saying actually somewhere between 2° and maybe 6° even 2° in many people's eyes is a dangerous climate change  6° warming over 100 years would be such a rapid warming that it would be very difficult to see how that wouldn't damage things irreparably to help me visualize what is in store for us Peter Cox invited me to see a film this is a vision of how and where the world will heat up if we continue down the path we're now on on this prediction suggests that by the year 201100 the south of England will have an average temperature lift of 2° yeah most people would think well that wouldn't be too bad I mean maybe the sou the south of France has come to to Southern England well it will be warmer there's no doubt it'll be warmer but there are obviously many aspects to climate change in Southern England particular we're concerned that we'll have drought conditions so summers will get quite a lot hot and dry and again people might think that was that was fine but also expect Chang in the extreme events more stormy conditions more flood conditions there's a lot more to the problem than just the warming it has been much drier in recent Summers but when we do see the rainfall it's very intense and again just about anywhere during the day could have some localized flash flooding from those torrential thunderstorms and it's going to be a pretty sultry day in Scotland as well the Met Office believes that in the future when it does rain it will pour some places in Britain especially in Winter are forecast to be five times more likely to  flood devastating flash floods in North Corner which demolished homes and left SC rain fell in less than 2 hours when the floodwaters swept through the old part of the village by the harbor without I've been utterly shocked at the devastation below me I'm looking down Sergeant shuy Thompson of the royal Air Force was among the rescue teams who saved 100 people during the 2004 boss castle flood I must ad me my first impression was um how how many people going to survive this as our climate changes extreme events like boss castle are more likely and emergency services are already preparing for them climate change uh is something that we're going to have to deal with it we are seeing a change in the in the weather so we do need to prepare for the fact that there may be more flash floods and and other dangerous situations and uh be prepared really uh to continue rescuing people maybe in a a more dramatic situation in the future and it's not just boss castle there's other valleys around um with um big tributes that are running into them and so this could really happen anywhere at any time we have always built built our houses and roads with the weather in mind but the continued effectiveness of our structures is something we can no longer take for granted this sea wall in Essex was built to protect the houses behind it from high tides and Storm surges and it's worked very well but the climate is changing and there is no guarantee that it'll give that protection in the future the houses that stand behind that wall like millions of homes all over the world are perilously close to sea level there are many such all along the Gulf Coast of America here hurricans occur every year in August 2005 many citizens of New Orleans thought Katrina was just another they felt secure behind levies that had been built extended and heightened since the 18th century little bit Panic this time oh no I'm okay but yeah it's it feels a little bit more dangerous than a blizzard so we'll be okay but Katrina caused the storm surge higher than the Asian tsunami four of New Orleans levies broke flooding 80% of the city and killing over a thousand   people man how do you get a house in that sort of a position hurricane expert Greg Holland thinks we need to be fortifying our defenses and preparing for the future now  so this is where the uh industrial Canal obviously broke and you just have to imagine a huge wall of water rushing all the way down through here taking out everything I mean there is nothing left anyone in this area was either dead or in extremely bad shape imagine the sort of Crash you'd have to have on highway to actually do this sort of damage incredible the worrying thing is that all the damage we see here was due to Hurrican Katrina which wasn't a particularly powerful hurricane think of the potential future destruction with the much more powerful hurricanes that are likely to occur with climate change the damage that we see around us here tells me that the future is here and we really do need to take appropriate action now on the other side of the world many Australians are also going to have to find new ways of fighting an old enemy here it isn't Rising Seas it's fire Our concern about climate change is that something appears to be happening we're not sure what it is bush fires are part of the Australian phenomenon they've been around for millions of years what's changing is the weather conditions and the volatility of the weather that's causing us real concern about how the fires behave the frequency of the fires Russell ree has spent the past 30 years firefighting in Victoria but after the hottest year on record he realizes that in future he'll need a new approach we've built fire Services traditionally around a belief and a well-honed theory about how fires behave fires become harder to control they become more unpredictable our normal methods of measuring fire Behavior are being put into question if things are changing then we have to rethink that we think rethink our resources our tactics our strategy the whole way we go about it so that we can defend and protect in this sort of  change in the future there is even a chance that Britain could have its share of forest fires I should Imagine by the time we get to the middle of the century there will be a significant risk increased risk that is of gas and forest fires just because things are so bone dry following the dry weather and the Heat and there's no sign of that letting up either and talking about heat and potential Forest fir as well  let's how reliable is this particular projection it depends on where you look I think if you look over the next few decades most models would agree on on the warming that we're likely to see we don't have very much Choice over what happens over the next 25 years because that's largely a function of what we've emitted in the past and so that sort of warming of one to two degrees across the UK for example is almost inevitable now um whether we end up at four or five or six is still very much in our control  the idea that the way the climate will change over the coming years is up to us is a sobering  thought we know that human activity on a large scale massive deforestation the near Universal use of fossil fuels is changing the climate but can anything that you I do individually can that have an effect well over half the carbon dioxide produced by mankind comes from our domestic activities meet the carbons they're a fictional family living somewhere in the Western World they occupy an average Suburban house outside an average city  the carbons depend on an average amount of electric power it comes to them by an energy grid powered primarily by fossil fuels coal oil and natural  gas the carbons are not bad people girls you want coffee pancakes but as westerners they have one of the most energy hungry lifestyles on the planet girls breakfast pancakes daddy cakes pancakes you want a  pancake I'll call you from the airport bye  bye Mr carbon's car like most spews out a lot of carbon dioxide and the carbon family has two cars every year between them they pump a staggering 20 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 10 tons per  car but it's not just the  cars Emily running the carbon's family home with all its Comforts uses almost as much energy as their vehicles  do every device functional or fun has a KnockOn  effect at the power plant scientists fear that at this rate these everyday emissions could within 50 years push our climate to a critical point where change is no longer gradual but sudden and extreme in the Arctic thousands of miles away from the carbon's home the ice is already melting the losses of sea ice have really just astounded us it's one of the most market and pervasive changes we've seen in the Arctic system and it has really opened our eyes if we compare the amount of Arctic SE ice we had back in about 1979 compared to what we have today we've lost an area roughly twice the size of the State of Texas in 20 short years this is really a remarkable pace of change that we've seen twice the size of Texas is over five times the size of the United Kingdom and it's not just the Arctic in 2002 at the other end of the world Antarctica's entire Lassen B ice shelf disintegrated when white ice is replaced by dark ocean it's the beginning of a sudden major change a Tipping Point where the warming accelerates dramatically this sea ice cover is so bright and white that it reflects so much of the sun's energy that falls on it right back up into space but if we start to warm up the Arctic and we start to melt down that ice cover what we do is we start to expose dark surfaces dark ocean and that dark ocean absorbs so much more of the sun's energy than the white ice did that the Arctic further heats up which implies further melt of the snow and ice cover and even further warming some predict that the summertime Arctic could be complet completely ice free as soon as 2070 and all that dark ocean will warm the planet even more we are in fact conducting a grand Global experiment and uh we're going to have to live with the outcome of that experiment  I don't know what human beings will react to that but but obviously uh the natural world will have great difficulty indeed in migrating to keep Pace with that over over a century that's absolutely right that's one of the biggest concerns it's happening now of course isn't it I mean Mediterranean species are coming into Britain yes but the one at the very top in the Arctic they've got nowhere to go that's right and that's also true with uh species migrating up mountains of  course so that's where you'd expect to see the impacts first and I think there's already evidence of that occurring on mountains yeah of mountain species changing and presumably a great number of those plants be pieces of plants and animals will disappear that's the worry yeah yeah the planet will change I think whatever happens now the planet is going to change the question is can we give it a soft Landing no one knows for sure what impact global warming will have on the world's animals and plants some predict that by the end of the century as as many as half of the world's species could be under threat of Extinction if their environment radically  changes animals with a particularly specialized way of life like South America's spectacled bear are just one of hundreds of mountain species at risk as the Andes heat up so sou Africa is predicted to be one of the worst affected  areas here and elsewhere animals will be forced to try and migrate on mass as their habitat is  transformed there will certainly be many  casualties there's no threat of Extinction in the carbon's house on the contrary there is plenty of food here often it will have crossed continents by the time it reaches their kitchen transporting this food accounts for over a tenth of the carbon's annual Greenhouse emissions and it doesn't end  there more carbon dioxide is produced by the carbon's rubbish   buried in a landfill the rubbish heats up as it decomposes releasing greenhouse gases into the air all the while the carbon dioxide blanket surrounding the earth is getting thicker push pushing the planet's ecosystems closer to the point of no  return let's look at Amazonia what's happening now we believe that if these projections are right then by the middle of this Century CO2 keeps going up the forest could actually start to die from climate change which would be absolutely catastrophic the Amazon rainforest is already suffering the devastating effects of drought in 2005 Rivers ran  dry and scientists like Dan nepstad have now discovered that the forest is facing a previously unimaginable  threat for decades and decades it was thought that these forests don't catch fire and then some some researchers started finding charcoal in the soil of forest deep in the in the Amazon of Venezuela we had to alert the government that they had a major catastrophe on their hand and the initial response was no it can't be these Forest is won't catch fire but more and more as the droughts gets more and more severe we see these forests being pushed over the edge NEP stat has already found evidence which points to a devastating future for the greatest Forest on   Earth for me one of the the scariest visions of the future of the Amazon is is what we see back here it's scrub Forest that's very nasty to walk through it keeps catching fire it's highly flammable and it's a very little worth to the the local people but it's not just local people who will be  affected if all of the forest is destroyed the carbon stored in the tissues of the trees up to 15 years worth of global emissions will be released into the atmosphere increasing the warming even more   so that's one of these um tipping points in the climate system where you could get to a carbon dioxide level where the forest is not sustainable and that for therefore means you get even more carbon dioxide and further climate change it it is a Tipping Point  we won't just lose the most diverse ecosystem on Earth we could also lose an Irreplaceable mechanism for cooling the planet we almost might think of it as the world's great air conditioner that as it takes in all of this sunshine and it converts about half of that Sunshine into water vapor and in doing that it's cooling off the planet and it's big enough to actually have an effect at the scale of the entire planet the Amazon uh may not be here it's it's frightening to me Mr carbon dreams of a tropical rainforest holiday but today he's on a business trip but when he flies he's contributing to the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide even even with plans for more efficient engines emissions from airlines worldwide are set to double in the next 25  years can you put your homework in your backpack yep together the carbons are responsible for a whopping 45 tons of carbon dioxide a year in cities all over the developed World millions of ordinary households produce great quantities of carbon dioxide simply by going about their daily lives so far it's the Western World which has produced the majority of the greenhouse gases  but that is set to change meet Mr and Mrs Tam they are a fictional couple living in an average Chinese suburb at present they use only a seventh of the energy consumed by the carbon  family but life for the Tans is changing  fast and they together with 1.3 billion Chinese are heading for a more energy intensive lifestyle Mr Tan has got a new job and it comes with a flat in the latest up Market development complete with state-of-the-art energy hungry fittings to fuel their economic boom China has one main cheap source of energy coal Coal is the most carbon dioxide polluting source of energy we have currently China is planning to build a large Coal Fired power plant every week for the next 7  years in as little as 20 years China is likely to become the world's number one greenhouse gas   emitter there is an explosion in energy consumption worldwide and by 2050 we're on course to have doubled the amount we  emit all the carbon dioxide reproduce doesn't stay forever in the atmosphere it's continually being absorbed by the world's oceans as the concentration in the atmosphere Rises so the oceans take up more and this could lead to another of those tipping points marine biologists like Steve Wham are now becoming concerned about the impact this is  having now that carbon dioxide does not stay up in the atmosphere almost half of it is dissolving into the oceans the result of that is that our surface oceans are becoming more acidic when carbon dioxide dissolves in water it raises the acidity and that could be lethal for many of today's sea  creatures if we look under here what we have here is a an animal that's very common to our Shores a beautiful animal this is uh this is a sea urchin um so this poor creature is going to be hit in two ways firstly the acidity of the ocean will mean that its shell will dissolve and secondly the chemicals it requires to build that shell are going to be in short supply here we have another animal which is actually closely related to the uh sea urchin this is the spiny starfish and the kind of effects that could have on animals such as the starfish and and the Sea urchin could be that the animals have difficulty in uh creating their skeletons they will also have difficulty in feeding in reproducing acidification poses the threat not only to individual species but to an entire food chain Plankton are floating plants and animals some of which are microscopic in size but they're so numerous that when they bloom they can be seen from space acidification could decimate Plankton which is food for a variety of fish and they in turn are food for larger and larger marine species this could even affect the largest mammals on Earth  the effects of acidification could be felt far beyond the oceans millions of people around the world rely on marine life for their  survival I mean this is almost like a warning this is what happens if we don't mend our ways as a species we have a lot of choice humankind has a lot of choice over where we end up by the end of the century because it's very much dependent on how much CO2 we emit between between now and uh the end of the  century so how do we cut down our carbon dioxide emissions some of the world's leading scientists are convinced that finding a solution is a matter of extreme urgency Professor Steve pakala is one of them I've worked on a variety of environmental problems in in my lifetime and usually you go into them and become a little bit less concerned as you go along the global warming problem is the reverse the people who are professionals and work on it become more and more concerned through  time for me this is the most serious of environmental problems and the it's the one that we need to solve  now if this is the amount of greenhouse gas that we emit into the at atmosphere every year today then 50 years from now we're going to be pumping out twice that much and to solve the problem of global warming and to prevent the the atmospheric blanket from more than doubling what we need to do instead is to freeze emissions at the current level for the next 50 years because there's no single way to solve the problem of global warming pakana has broken it into seven equal pieces he's then suggested a different way we can solve each slice one at a time until we reach the ultimate goal of halting the rise of carbon emissions I've looked at it closely and I believe that it can be solved by this generation the technology now exists to solve the greenhouse warming problem if we develop the collective will to implement it the first of Steve P Cara's slices can be dealt with using technology close at hand I met carbon counting Guru Dave Ray to find out how we can all set our house in order okay so here is a newly built house this is where really climate change begins our houses represent a huge amount of Emissions on a on a household bases in the UK each household emits about 25 tons of greenhouse gas every year so they're a huge contributor to our climate impact let's have a look inside  so this is a a prime example of a lot of energy use um going on in the home and actually a lot of wastage what this thermostat absolutely yeah and this one's set too high for every degree we reduce it we'll save about a third of a ton of greenhouse gas every year every year so that comes down yeah and I wear a jersey you yeah dress for the weather is the B some  line how about good morning so the carbons bundled up for the winter have turned their thermostat down 3° it saves the money on their electricity bill and each year it keeps a ton of carbon out of the atmosphere  television yeah this is this is a big one if we look at some of these um gadgets down here we've got lots of little lights they're using energy even when you're not watching television and together in the average home they're now accounting for about 10% of our electricity use all these things on standby power so they're draining electricity from the grid 10% of all household electri electricity yeah goes on on complete waste simply standing by it's basically electricity just to power little lights I have to say I had no idea it was a size that the rule of thumb is if you finish using something then turn it off it isn't that the turning on and off a set damages it well if there is then the manufacturers have a real problem that they need to sort out there are dozens of things we can do around the house from comp ing vegetable waste to switching to energy saving light bulbs so that really will help preserve the Arctic Ice C just by changing the bulb it'll do a tiny bit in the right  direction this is good news for this house because it's a gas hob rather than an electric one the more insulation the better for an average fridge you can save 200 kg of greenhouse gas just by keeping the thing clean and buying locally grown food can cut down on the food miles and they're grown right here that's pretty cool if we all made the most efficient choices in our homes and offices we would reduce those emissions by a quarter and cut off one of Steve bala's global warming  slices perhaps the simplest way most of us can combat global warming is to change the way we drive the carbons have opted for a more fuele efficient car if by mid-century 2 billion of the world's cars can do 60 m to the gallon it would deal with one more of the seven slices  or if we all Drive half as much as we do now which might mean using public transport instead we will also clust a  slice another major challenge is to find carbon free sources of power however controversial tripling the world's nuclear power would cut our emissions by a further  slice this is a solar farm 3 acres of solar panels dedicated to collecting energy directly from the Sun renewable sources of energy such as solar panels are able to produce electricity with no carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere at all and these might be scaled up to provide a sizable fraction of the solution to the global warming  problem in countries like China solar is set to make a real difference Brit 's climate however has never been perfect for solar power but there are other natural resources we have plenty  of our country is the windiest place in Europe  it's impossible to comprehend the sheer size of these towers unless you get really close to them as I am now there's nothing to give you scale but they are immense the diameter of the rotor is 90 M that's almost as long as a football pitch and to my eyes they're beautiful what's best about them is that once running they don't give off carbon dioxide but they're not cheap and worldwide we would need 700,000 more turbines like these to cut another slice off Global emissions that's a very big Wind Farm of course wind farms are only one of a number number of potential sources of new energy and it's quite clear that if we're really going to tackle climate change we have to think even bigger Steve Paka believ strongly that the technology we already have can save us he's on his way to visit one of the newest techniques and they don't get much bigger than this  200 kilm off Norway's Coast lies the slier gas rig this is one of the largest objects ever lifted by people and it's sitting here on the sea floor for the sole purpose of of keeping harm out of the atmosphere the people who extract fossil fuels like oil and gas have now come up with a way to put carbon dioxide back  underground already every year a million tons of carbon dioxide are being pumped down into the Rocks hundreds of meters below the seabed the Norwegians have estimated that we could store all of Europe's carbon dioxide emissions for the next few hundred years in this way but we would need need several thousand of these rigs around the world to get another slice closer to the solution this isn't a Magic Bullet this is maybe 15% of the solution for the Next Generation or so what really has me worried is the number of things that we don't yet fully understand that I call monsters behind the door this is exactly the kind of technology that could keep those monsters from ever coming out from behind their doors it's going to give us an additional Bridge To The Future for our children and their children and their children this is our watch and we have to get it started so that we can leave them with a world in which the monsters are still behind the doors already change is in the air and people all over the world are waking up to the urgent need to deal with global warming expanding economies like China are developing new technologies to combat increasing emissions and are encouraging the people to get involved in tree planting the task ahead of us is vast but we can all make a difference at every level even the smallest all right well now let's get this clear it's not about stopping making ourselves Cups of Tea we're talking about living the life more or less as we've lived it before but more efficiently yeah waste is the source of the trouble not actually living please make me a cup of tea certainly will so the first thing I'm going to do is we don't fill it with water obviously we just need water for two mugs doesn't matter which na it is it's it's important don't waste it now to make the good cup of tea you got to make it while it's hot yeah you didn't warm the pot I didn't warm the pot oh well we'll see what the quality of the tea is like  cheers any good  r as you travel into the future it's clear that there are some steps that we can take both big and small to reduce carbon emissions but because we're talking about the future we can't be sure where we are going but one thing is certain if we do nothing we'll end up in deep water if we continue to warm our planet we may accelerate the Meltdown of the world's ice resulting in a catastrophic rise in sea level recent satellite evidence has revealed that not only is the green land ice cap melting it's doing so twice as fast as previously thought scientists now fear that we are approaching the Tipping Point where the complete meltdown of Greenland's ice is inevitable if it does melt it will cause sea levels to rise by as much as 7 m this may take centuries but it should surely concern us all that our actions today could condemn the future world to  disaster the combination of melting ice and warming Waters will expand the Seas and this could raise their level by half a meter before the century is out when you remember that half of humanity inhabits the coastal zones around the world sea level rise is a frightening Prospect   the islands of the United Kingdom are not immune if the Greenland ice Camp melts the sea will flood much of the southeast including Central London  in fact many of the world's most famous cities would be engulfed by the ocean it would take far less to drown much of Florida with just a 5 m rise much of the state would be submerged and the City of Miami would be 50 Mi offshore the same rise would wipe half of Bangladesh home to 120 million people almost entirely off the map millions of people would be displaced   worldwide scientists predict that global warming could displace 150 million people within 50 years  you you spend your working life uh pondering on this kind of change and this kind of effect doesn't it uh depress you deeply how do you get up in the morning and survive um it is I mean I think if you see it as a a forone conclusion you can't help but be depressed by the prospect um but I don't all climate modelers would like to be wrong  so when I look at these if I just believe that was an inevitability I would undoubtedly be very depressed not necessarily for myself because in the next decade or so we can probably deal with it but certainly for my kids and for ultimately for my grandchildren it would be extremely depressing Prospect but I still think we can do something about it that's the big challenge now is to get some action on behalf of future generations to avoid some these worst impacts I must say I think if um if you had to look in your grandchildren's eyes and say yeah I knew that it was going to happen but I didn't bother to do anything about it that that would be a terrible thing wouldn't that be the worst thing of all for any generation to say that we left something like that for future generations to pick up and we knew about it we knew about the problem but we didn't do with it that would be the worst thing of all they we have to avoid that exactly  so in the past we didn't understand the effect of our actions unknowingly we sowed the wind and now literally we are reaping the Whirlwind but we no longer have that excuse now we do recognize the consequences of our Behavior now surely we must act to reform it individually and collectively nationally and internationally before we Doom future generations to catastrophe for a free guide about climate change

7,David Atenbourough,thank you very very much the first programs I made about Natural History when I accompanied a team from the London Zoo to go and collect an animal's rare animals in West Africa you wouldn't dream of doing that these days in those days zoos thought that their mission was to find rare animals and sage people this is the last one in the world isn't that exciting aren't you lucky to see it things have changed seriously since then and indeed it wasn't soon afterwards I was speaking now about 50 years ago 60 years ago soon afterwards the penny began to drop people in zoos began to realize that their mission wasn't to find the rarest thing and boast about it the thing was to try and save some of the species that were disappearing so then that was the time when conservation organizations began to get going and you realized you had to save the giant panda the Hawaiian goose the Arabian oryx the mountain gorillas and you congratulated yourselves on how clever you were that we's preachers had been saved from extinction and then you began to realize that actually just one animal by itself or one species by itself was of no consequence what was the consequence in the only way you would actually really save it was to save the entire ecosystem so we had to start looking after the tropical rainforest and we have to look after the Arctic tundra and we had to look after our own woodlands in this country and that was an advance but since then we've made another advance and that is that is no longer isolated ecosystems that were a danger entire world is in danger if we are to save it people have to realize that the world is on our doorstep that we are part of the world that we have to conserve it that the world is not there for plundering we are part of the natural systems and if we wish to save ourselves we have to save those natural systems and they have never ever been it hazard in the way our they are at this moment we are at a hinge moment things are taking a bad turn things do not look good what are we to do the first way we have to do is to persuade human beings in this world this strange powerful stupid serious species that things are not going right well why did you do that you do that by bringing them face to face with the complexity the beauties and the importance of the natural world and how do you do that the United Nations tell us that the majority of human beings on this world over 50% are urbanized and out of touch with the natural world they have to be allowed to see it to understand it to love it and who can do that ladies and gentlemen you can the world depends on an understanding of the natural world and where does that start for the majority of human beings on their doorstep into their gardens if they are lucky enough to have them so you have a great responsibility to bring the realities of the natural world to the understanding and the love of human beings worldwide and that is why I shall treasure this person this medal thank you very much I have one more surprise I have one more surprise for Sir David the board of trustees at the landscape Institute unanimously agreed with my request that we also make Sir David an honorary fellow of the landscape Institute so will you please welcome Eric Anderson and president elect Jane Finley to the stage please thank you you,speech at LI Awards 2019,2019/11/29,Youtube
8,David Atenbourough, I am quite literally from another age I was born during the Holocene the name given by scientists to the twelve thousand year period of climatic stability that allowed humans to settle farm and create civilizations those conditions fostered our unique minds giving rise to international trade in ideas as well as goods and making us the globally connected species that we are today lots of what will be discussed here is the consequence of that stability global businesses international cooperation and the striving power ideals these are all possible because for millennia on a global scale Nature has been largely predictable and stable now in the space of one human lifetime indeed in the space of my lifetime all that has changed the Holocene has ended the Garden of Eden is no more we have changed the world so much that scientists say that we are now in a new geological age the Anthropocene the age of humans when you think about it there is perhaps no more unsettling thought the only conditions modern humans have ever known so far are changing and changing fast it's tempting and understandable to ignore the evidence and carry on as usual or to be filled with gloom and doom but there is also a vast potential for what we might do we need to move beyond guilt or blame and get on with the practical tasks in hand we didn't get to this point to deliberately it just happened astonishingly quickly when I made my first television programmes most of the audience's had never seen a Pangolin indeed a few pangolins had ever seen the television camera but when in 1979 I made a series tracing the history of life on Earth I was aware of environmental problems I didn't imagine that we were fundamentally changing nature in 1999 whilst making the Blue Planet series about marine life we filmed coral bleaching but I still didn't appreciate the magnitude of the damage that had already started now however we have evidence knowledge and the ability to share it on a scale unimaginable even just a few years ago movements and ideas can spread at astonishing speed the audience for that first series 60 years ago was restricted to just a few million viewers in southern England my next fear is our planet which is about to be launched here will go instantly the hundreds of millions of people in almost every country on Earth by a Netflix and the evidence the support in the series will be free to view by everybody with an internet connection by a WWF if people could truly understand what is at stake I believe that they will give permission to business and government to get on with practical solutions and as a species we are expert problem solvers but we haven't yet applied ourselves to this problem with the focus that it requires we can create a world with clean air and water unlimited energy and fish stocks that will sustain us well into the future but to do that we need a plan over the next two years there will be United Nations decisions on climate change sustainable development and a new deal for nature together these will form our species plan for a route through the Anthropocene what we do now and in the next few years will profoundly affect the next few thousand years I look forward very much to the discussions and insights that will go on here this week and I thank you again for this very great honor,WEF Davos 2019,2019/1/22,Youtube
9,David Atenbourough, I remember very clearly in the early 1940s most school and the chemistry teacher came into the class and he said boys you are very very lucky we have progressed technologically we used to say the earliest stage was the Stone Age and that was followed by the Bronze Age and following that the Iron Age then came the steam age but you would grow up in a new age you lucky people you're going to go up in the age of plastic and we looked at him then he went on and said plastic is this marvelous material he can be molded in all kinds of ways all kinds of purposes and most remarkable or it is virtually indestructible and he didn't say we didn't say and as far as I can make out no one said but what happens then if you can't destroy it now the world globally is producing every year four hundred million tons of plastic and over ten million tons of that goes into the ocean every year and I won't go on about the hideous consequences of this births as humanity and to the life in the seas upon which we depend because you Joe who's following me will do that in the beginning years of first years of this new millennium I was invited to work on a program called blue Palace and my contribution was limited Simpsons of the words there's a whole team of people who started to try and chopped your life of the see of what was happening into the life of the scene and that film Illustrated very well the problems of plastic and what we were doing to the ocean as a part the main part was about to show you what was going on in the sea and that remained and it made a certain impact I suppose it was too serious called and one of the production team a very remarkable woman in my book was so moved by what she discovered when she was researching that she actually gave up her job and decided that she would work herself one woman she would get on with it and do something about rousing the nation's conscious because all that plastic in we produce in this country and this is a matter of shame is it not all this plastic we try to dispose of but actually we can't and we export it to export it to other countries around the world to ask them to do our dirty work China has refused to have it at last where's it gonna go but now let me introduce you to that woman who was concert as a consequence of her work that we produced a sequel to bloom panic it was called blue planet 2 and for reasons which I cannot identify for some reason rather it rang a bell for some reason or other the correspondence which we received about the one short sequence about plastic was almost overwhelming,Speech Plastics in the ocean,2019/11/11,Youtube
10,David Atenbourough, the heating of our planet has already reached the point that the impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable people are profound but this is only the beginning of this crisis in the last 150 years the world has warmed on average by just over one degree celsius and our atmosphere now contains concentrations of carbon dioxide that have not been equaled for millions of years we are today perilously close to tipping points that once passed will send global temperatures spiraling catastrophically higher if we continue on our current path we will face the collapse of everything that gives us our security food production access to fresh water habitable ambient temperature and ocean food chains and if the natural world can no longer support the most basic of our needs then much of the rest of civilization will quickly break down please make no mistake climate change is the biggest threat to security that modern humans have ever faced i don't envy you the responsibility that this places on all of you and your governments we have left the stable and secure climatic period that gave birth to our civilizations there is no going back no matter what we do now it's too late to avoid climate change and the poorest and most vulnerable those with the least security are now certain to suffer our duty right now is surely to do all we can to help those in the most immediate danger but of course we have a parallel duty and it's here where i think there are grounds for hope while it's true we can never go back to the stable benign climate that enabled us to flourish for the past 10 000 years i do believe that if we act fast enough we can reach a new stable state in november this year at cop 26 in glasgow we have what may be our last opportunity to make this step change if we recognize climate change and the loss of nature as worldwide security threats as indeed they are then we may yet act proportionately and in time the change needed in itself sounds immense and of course it is but we already have many of the technologies needed at least for the initial changes and perhaps crucially we also have a level of public support and demand for action that i have myself never seen before people today all over the world now realize this is no longer an issue which will affect future generations it is people alive today and in particular young people who will live with the consequences of our actions politicians and business leaders know this too having seen how quickly and radically their societies and global activities were affected by covid it is now sadly easier to imagine some of the consequences of climate change perhaps the most significant lesson brought by these last 12 months has been that we are no longer separate nations each best served by looking after its own needs and security we are a single truly global species whose greatest threats are shared and whose security must ultimately come from acting together in the interests of us all climate change is a threat to global security that can only be dealt with by unparalleled levels of global cooperation it will compel us to question our economic models and where we place value invent entirely new industries recognize the moral responsibility that wealthy nations have to the rest of the world and put a value on nature that goes far beyond money and through global cooperation we may achieve far more than tackling climate change we may finally create a stable healthy world where resources are equally shared and where we thrive in balance with the rest of the natural world we may for the first time in the entire history of humanity come to know what it feels like to be secure,UN security council,2023/2/21,Youtube
