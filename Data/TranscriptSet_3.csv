1,Nelson Mandela,I stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you the yes you yes I was very much surprised I uh took it for granted that he would win yes no I never did  well uh I do not know that is for others to say  uh no except just skipping exercises press ups and so on you know and weight lifting no it really was not difficult because uh the diet they gave us although it was bad and sometimes very unpalatable but they did give you the basics of a nutritious food like fish meat and vegetables and sometimes fruits during the fruit season  yes  that was one of our principal fights now uh colored and Indians uh received better food than ourselves and Africans had the poorest diet as you would imagine in fact we live on mielie pap in the morning Miellies for lunch and Mielli pup in the evening what is Miellie pup can you explain it to am you know it's a millies ground and cooked like porridge you see yes yes uh although I'm very reluctant to talk about that because I was directly involved and uh we had a clash with the warders who came to fetch us from Cape Town across uh the uh sea to Robin Island they wanted us at to rush and uh uh and they lined us up we were four of us I was uh at the back with another comrade and there were two others in front and uh they uh were very harsh and then I whispered to my uh colleagues that look we must fight right from the beginning they must know what type of men we are right from the beginning and we must not give the impression that they can issue instructions and say which conflict with our principles if they are carrying out the regulations we will obey that but where they overstep the limit we must fight and resist oh yes several times isolation was very difficult especially because they starved you for some days and uh uh I went to isolation several times although I was sent to isolation and uh with uh the order that I should forfeit certain meals but I was able to get meals because the warders did not want to conform to the regulations and who did everything to make it possible for us in know to survive oh yes you remember his name yes that was warant officer Gregory Gregory yes oh no he is uh a first class gentleman in every respect he never raises his voice he is patient he's very calm I uh became very friendly with him in in fact when I left prison I think he was on the point of breaking down because we were now closing a friendship under those circumstances which had lasted for so long well I did feel uh not happy about leaving him behind and uh but there was nothing else I could do yes sudden certain I'll do so  well it's very difficult in prison you not to isolate uh prisoners especially political prisoners because uh where there are human beings and uh where men fight back uh for their rights and for their dignity they will immediately be people who will admire you and that admiration will be shown by specific acts uh which shows that uh uh people think that uh your state is correct the first uh um isolation first punishment which I got was when I um uh was given a newspaper by Warder and he had been doing this is over some time but one day the authorities must have got a tip and they came to my cell and raid it and found the paper and they sent me to isolation for that they punished me that is true to spend uh 27 years at the primary of your life is a tragedy and uh I regret you know those years that I have wasted in prison but uh there are very positive aspects too because I had the opportunity to think about problems and to reflect on my mistakes I also had the opportunity of reading very widely and uh especially biographies and I could see what men sometimes from very humble beginnings were able to lift themselves with their boot strings and become International figures and men were useful to society in their own community and to the world,ABC Koppel and Nelson Mandela interview,1990/2/11,Youtube
2,Nelson Mandela,after the rousing welcome i have received here i do not know whether i am in a mood to think coolly i have been deeply touched by this warm welcome but to respond to the question i must say that the anc and in fact the entire to promote the struggle again supported in our country and i must say to you that we have the support not only of the masses of the people we have the support not only of the masses of the people we have the support of the congress as well as the government and i think that it would not be proper for me to delve into the controversial issues which are tearing the society of this country apart i am sure that the usa has produced the competent leaders of all of all population groups who are able to handle their own affairs very effectively well i am sure of one thing that he condemns about it as i do that is enough for us to find further common room with the president and this is the message that i'm going to put to him when i meet him that i cannot say that lies in the future but when i address congress the main trust of my speech is that the congress should support sanctions i should know better about this matter mr Koppel than you after all it is the anc not the government that is responsible for the present talks we have been hammering the government since 1986 tomatoes endings and in spite of the humiliating and insulting conditions they tried to impose on us before they could agree to meeting us we nevertheless had sufficient patience and sufficient commitment to peace as to continue hammering them to meet us they have eventually done so but despite the fact that the talks are now on apartheid is still in place the police are still killing our people as they've done over the years vigilante groups are openly arming themselves for the specific purpose of a turkey progressive groups and progressive leaders their right wing is also arming it itself openly and they say they are doing so for the purpose of destroying the anc they are calling for some of us to be heard why would you think that we should now relax our strategies what has happened i knew that that that was the question you wanted to ask i'm happy that you've had the courage to put it directly we are not concerned with models we are not concerned with labels we are practical men and women whose solutions are dictated by the actual conditions existing in our country as somebody has said we do not care whether the cat is black or white as long as it can catch mice if I may what we want what we want to achieve is a healthy and vibrant economy which can ensure full employment to our people maximum production and the development of social justice we wanted to rectify the imbalances that exist in our economy one of the companies well-known companies in the country one company owns more than 75 percent of the shirts quoted in the johannesburg stock exchange this is illustrative of how our economy is organized it is moderate the the resources of the country economy are monopolized by a white minority even in that minority by a few individuals whereas the masses of the people especially blacks are left poor ridden with disease illiteracy without educational facilities we wanted to develop an economy which will put an end to that and will leave to other people to put a label if they so wish Aangename kennis Koos ek hoop van harte dat eendag ek die geleenheid sal kry dat U het geserg well just to interpret please what i said i just wanted to demonstrate that i am bilingual all i have said to question them ever is to say i am happy to know you i hope that one day we shall have the opportunity to discuss the affairs of our country that is all mr de klerk is an independent resource resourceful and flexible leader he is able on his own to deal with the right wing the outside world will be making a grave mistake if they think they can do anything whatsoever to help mr de Klerk as against the right wing in fact for the international community to seek to do anything expressly to help mr de Klerk would be the best way of undermining him because what the right wing is doing is to tell the whites in south africa that de Klerk is a puppet of the united states and great britain and that what he is doing now is precisely because he has received instructions from those two countries and if now the western world comes out to say they want to help de klerk that is what the right wing exactly wants you will destroy him we the anc are the only people who can help him and we are doing our very best to help him one of the points we are putting to him is that mr de Klerk if he wants to see the future non-racial south africa emerging is to speed up in regard to the negotiating process that in a year or two he should be able to to extend the vote to all south africans he must cease a thinking in terms of solutions by seeking a mandate to white only he must place himself in a position where he can get the support of the overwhelming majority of the people of south africa and if he gives every man and woman whatever the color of his game the right to vote he will be in an extremely strong position and there's nothing that the right wing can do but if he continues as he is doing at the present moment still to think of racist solutions solutions which are seen first and foremost as protecting the rights of the whites one of the mistakes one of the mistakes which has some political honors make is to think that their enemies should be our enemies that we can and we will never do we have our own struggle which we are conducting we are grateful to the world for supporting our struggle but nevertheless we are an independent organization with its own policy and the attitude of every country towards our attitude towards any country is determined by the attitude of that country too yasa Arafat colonel gaddafi fidel castro support our struggle to the hilt there is no reason whatsoever why we should have any hesitation about hailing their commitment to human rights as they are being demanded in south africa our attitude is based solely on the fact that they fully support the anti-apartheid struggle they do not support it only in rhetoric they are placing resources at our disposal for us to win the struggle that is the position to say first that when i had the pleasure and honor of meeting firstly we are a liberation movement which is fully involved in a struggle to emancipate our people from one of the worst racial tyrannies the world has seen we have no time to be looking into the internal affairs of other countries it is unreasonable for anybody to think that this is our role it i have been asked by somebody wants me to express an opinion on the differences that are taking place within the usa and he has made his position quite clearly that there is racialism in this country i have refused to be drawn into that why should mr siegmund accept my refusal to be withdrawn into the internal affairs of the united states and at the same time want me to be involved in the internal affairs of libya and cuba i refuse to do that as far as yasa arafat is concerned i explained to mr sidney that we identify with the plo because that just like ourselves they are fighting for the right of self-determination i went further however to say that the support for yasa arafat in his struggle does not mean that the anc has ever doubted the right of israel to exist as a state legally legally we have stood quite openly and firmly for the right of that state to exist within secured borders but of course as i said to mr siegmund in geneva and others that we carefully define what we mean by secure borders we do not mean that israel has the right to retain borders the territories they conquered from the arab world like the gaza strip the golan heights and the west bank we don't agree with that those territories should be returned to the Arab people i also explained to mr siegmund and company that in our organization we have jews in fact we have jews in fact mr gaddafi did not allow us to open our offices in libya precisely because we had the courage to say to him we work with the jews in our organization and he didn't allow us to open an office until february this year when he had to accept us as we are we are not prepared to be saved by anybody we have an independent policy which we accept no matter with whom we discuss the black people of america of the usa the black people of america of the usa have a lot to offer the people of south africa in the course of their struggle whatever disabilities you have in this country at least you have been exposed to opportunities which we don't have you have better educational facilities there is no legal caliber in this country and therefore you have been able to acquire in spite of your problems you have been able to acquire expert knowledge skills which we require especially when during the poster part of south which you can help us a great deal by making that expertise available to us as far as the question of who you can contact keep in contact with in our country that we can discuss after this occasion uh sanger i do not think it's correct uh sanger i do not think it's correct for me to wash our dirty linen in a foreign country even though it is i am hesitant to do that even though here i am among the comrades in arms i have the feeling that i am among the comrades in arms rather than sister one thing i would like to dispel with all the force at my command is that there is no difference with all whatsoever between myself and my organization on the attitude towards encounter and yourself in person if i have not seen you it is because of decisions which we have carefully discussed amongst ourselves and of which i am part i however would like to repeat what you know i have said on numerous occasions i would like the anc and inkata to sit down and resolve our problems and end the violence that is going on today in natal but you know as well as i do that the question is no longer simple the government has taken advantage of that the differences between my organization and your organization they are using those differences for the purpose of trying to eliminate the anc and what they consider to be members of that organization who are a threat to white supremacy that now is our problem it is no longer just a question of me meeting you i have asked mr de Klerk the simple question i have said to him you have a strong efficient and well-equipped army and police force can you tell me why the government has failed to suppress violence in which almost four thousand blacks have been killed mr de Klerk has never been able to give a satisfactory answer to my question i have told him i've given him the answer i have said to him you have not suppressed this violence deliberately because you believe that by using these differences between these two organizations you can crush your enemy number one the anc that is your difficulty and i must repeat to you that is the main problem facing the people of south africa it is the involvement of the government and its police in the violence that is taking place in natal thank you i do not consider your remarks as a lecture to me because because you would know because that it is the anc and not the government that has compelled the government to sit down and talk peace with us it is the anc that is mobilizing the entire country today around the question of peace you would also know that i have made several calls at public rallies that no solution is possible in south africa without involving chief utilities you would know this i have made that call not once but several times but it is the government that is responsible for all our problems in regard to natal the questions that i have put to mr de Klerk he has not been able to answer i wonder if you can answer them the government has had no hesitation whatsoever in suppressing similar violence before why is it has not even attempted to suppress that violence after all no government anywhere in the world can tolerate violence in which close to 4 000 people have been killed without intervening why is your government not intervening that is the question that you must answer thank you very much in the words of the prophet isaiah we have risen up as on the wings of eagles their old order is crumbling but the age of freedom has not yet done  i do not understand what you mean perhaps uh if you clarify what you are referring to i may be in a position to comment one of the problems we are facing in the world today are people who do not look at problems objectively but from the point of view of their own interests that makes things difficult because it is extremely difficult to reach an agreement one of the best examples of this is to think that because arafat is conducting a struggle against the state of israel that we must therefore condemn him we can't do that it is just not possible for any organization of or individual of integrity to do anything of the sort no mr Koppel i don't agree with you i am saying that it would be a grave mistake for us to consider our attitude towards yasa arafat on the basis of the interest of the jewish community we sympathize with the struggles of the of the jewish community we sympathize with the struggles of the jewish people and their persecution right down the years in fact we have been very much influenced by the lack of racialism amongst the jewish communities in our own country in the political that have taken place when few lawyers were prepared to defend us it has been the jewish lawyers who have come forward to defend us i myself i myself was articulate i'm a lawyer by profession and i was trained to become a lawyer by a jewish fair at a time when few firms in our country were prepared to take blacks and as i have said we have many jews members of the jewish community in our struggle and they have occupied very top positions but that does not mean to say that the enemies of israel are our enemies we refuse to take that position you can call it being political or a moral question but for anybody who changes his principles on whom he is dealing that is not a man who can lead a nation oh oh apparently mr Koppel you have not listened to my argument if you have done so then you have not been serious in examining it i have replied to one of our friends here that i have refused to be drawn into the differences that exist between various communities inside the usa you have not commented that i am going to offend anybody by refusing to involve myself in the internal affairs of the usa why are you so keen that i should involve myself in the internal affairs of cuba and libya i expect you to be consistent i don't know if i've paralyzed you well as far as the jewish question to begin with i have had discussions at my own initiative with prominent jewish leaders to straighten out this affair amongst the people i saw was mrs helen susman who has been an mp in our country for more than 30 years there was mr masons who has been a judge in lesotho botswana and the old Rodesha there was the chief rabbi of johannesburg there was professor katz from the university of the Witwatersrand and an eminent uh community leader in south africa we discussed this question and all misunderstanding was clear the question of yasa arafat and the plo i have also discussed the question with the jewish leaders in the usa and very top people like mr siegmund we reached an agreement on this question and we saw eye to eye now i don't know where your concern arises the jewish leaders themselves are able to determine their own affairs nobody else is entitled to say that the jewish leaders are going to be concerned about your state because i justify because i have heard the discussions with them and those discussions with rich consensus but there are matters of course in which we did not agree but the position which we take as the anc i thought we were able to explain it in such a way that it removed the concern of the jewish community i am still prepared to do that even in this talk if the jewish leader have any doubts about our stand i am prepared to address them and to allay at their concern because they are a very important community both in south africa and of course in the states and i'm prepared to iron out any differences that might exist but they must know what our stand is arafat is a comrade in arm and we treat him as such well mr Koppel i think i would have an easier task if you ask me to pass a vote of thanks to senator bone he has said all the things that are required to be said in regard to the problems of south africa he has a very positive attitude and he is constructive he is one of those men who are concerned not with fights only in his own country in his own region he is one of those men who have selected the world as a theater for their own efforts for their own operations and it is refreshing to be in the presence of such a man as far as giving a signal uh to de Klerk is concerned i have warned that it will be a serious mistake for the outside world to do anything with the stated objective of helping mr de Klerk because it is that type of attitude which has enabled the right wing to increase its popularity as far as the whites are concerned please whatever you do don't do that i have said the anc is the best organization to help mr de klerk we are addressing that question and i might disclose to you now that we have already that is the anc we have already started speaking to the right wing we have already spoken to a very influential member of the right wing and those discussions were very possible positive and they raised hope for greater development in our relations with the right wing don't interfere in this question i can i accept your born a few days in this regard but you are playing with fire if you think in terms of rewarding mr de Klerk because you will undermine his position uh considerable we are however having discussions with mr de Klerk and i am optimistic that we are going to make progress i think he is as determined as we are to see to if that south africa becomes a non-racial society free of all forms of racialism i am convinced about this the only respect in which you can give a signal to both the national party to both the government and the anc is to consult both these organizations as to what you could do to facilitate the process of peaceful negotiations it is not a matter that can be discussed in a meeting of this nature this is an extremely sensitive matter which if right the right time the time is right and the element of confidentiality is retained there can be an exchange of opinion but  to think in terms of rewarding one side one party and that is de kerk is a serious mistake well i don't think that we mean that means the same thing what the certain sections of the international community are saying is that mr de klerk should be rewarded because he has done something to deserve that and the first difficulty i have about that is that mr de klerk has done nothing we have done something what are you rewarding him for that's the first question that's the first question now mr Koppel you are entirely misinformed in the first place the anc ought never to have been banned secondly my comrades and i ought never have been sent to prison the state of emergency ought to never have to have been improved you are crediting mr de klerk for rectifying his own mistakes his own his own injustices you must remember that in in enforcing apartheid many of our people have been killed and many of our people have been executed for resisting a policy which the government now admits is an evil system what are you rewarding g him for as against that background that is the question as i mentioned we have come here to say we are fighting against injustice help us as the masses of the people of south africa who are living under repressive laws a repressive system help us to destroy repression there's no question of reward we are not saying to the outside world help us reward us for having negotiated initiated the peace talks we are saying that reward they should go to the people of south africa as a whole not to any particular organization they front the people of south africa the front line states the organization of african unit the non-aligned movement the general assembly of the united nations are all agreed nations that until fundamental and irreversible changes take place in the policy of the country sanctions must be maintained i am not here putting forward the views of an individual or of an individual organization i am putting to you what is being said by the entire world they insist that the sanctions should be maintained until fundamental and irreversible t changes take place in the policy of the country i want to give you an autograph somebody got a piece of paper that please thank you i've got one i've what is your name bernard i see that bernard i see that thank you well Bernard thank you very much,City College New York Downhill,1990/6/21,Youtube
3,Nelson Mandela,Mr Speaker Mr President esteemed members of the United States Congress your excellencies ambassadors and members of The Diplomatic C distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen it is a fact of the human condition that each shall like a meteor a mere brief passing moment in time and space flit across the human stage and pass out of existence even the golden LS and losses as much as the chimney sweepers come and tomorrow are no more after them all they leave the people and multi permanent accepted to the extent that the same Humanity might abuse its own genius to emulate life itself and so we have come to Washington in the district of Colombia and into these hell chambers of the United States congress not as Pretenders greatness but as a particle of a people whom we know to be Noble and heroic uring multiplying permanent rejoicing in the expectation and knowledge that they are Humanity will be reaffirmed and enlarged by open and unfettered communion with the nations of the world we have come here to tell you and through you your own people who are equally Noble and heroic of the troubles and trials the found hopes and aspirations of the people from from whom we originate we believe that we know it as a fact that your kind and moving invitation to us to speak here derived from your own desire to convey a message to our people and according to your Humane purposes to give them an opportunity to say what they want of you and what they want to make of their relationship with you our people demand democracy our country which continues to bleed and suffer pain needs democracy it cries out for the situation where the law will decree that freedom to speak of Freedom constitutes the very essence of legality and the very thing that makes for the legitimacy of the Constitutional order it thirs for the situation where those who are entitled by law to carry arms as the forces of National Security and Law and Order will not turn their weapons against the Citizens simply because the citizens asset that equality liberty and the pursuit of happiness are fundamental human rights which are not only inalienable but must if necessary be defended with the weapons of war we fight for and visualize a future in which all shall without regard to race color creed or sex have the right to vote and to be voted into all elective organs of State we are engaged in struggle to ensure that the rights of every individual are guaranteed and protected through a democratic Constitution the rule of law an entrenched Bill of Rights which should be enforced by an independent Judiciary as well as a multi-party political system Mr Speaker we are acutely conscious of the fact that we are addressing an historic Institution for whose creation and integrity many men and women lost their lives in the war of independence the Civil War and the war against Nazism and fascism that very history demands that we address you with respect and kindor and without any attempt to dismember what we have said concerning the political Arrangements we seek for our country is seriously meant it is an outcome of for which many of us went to prison for for which many have died in police cells on The Gallows in our towns and Villages and in the countries of southern Africa indeed we have even had our political Representatives killed in countries as far away from South Africa as France unhappily our people continue to die to this day victims of armed agents of the state who are still determined to turn their guns against the very idea of a non-racial democracy but this is the perspective which we trust Congress will feel happy to support and encourage using the enormous weight of its Prestige and Authority as an eminent representative of democratic practice to deny any person their human rights is to challenge their very Humanity to impose on them a wretched life of hunger and deprivation is to dehumanize them but such has been the terrible fate of all black persons in our country under the system of a party the extent of the deprivation of millions of people has to be seen to be believed the injury is made that more intolerable by the opulence of our White comrpar and the deliberate Distortion of the economy to feed that opulence the process of the Reconstruction of South African society must and will also entail the transformation of its economy we need a strong and growing economy we require an economy that is able to address the needs of all the people of our country that can provide food houses Education Health Services Social Security and everything that makes human life human that makes life joyful and not a protracted encounter with hopelessness and despair we believe that the fact of the apartheid structure of the South African economy and the enormous and pressing needs of the people make it inevitable that the democratic government will intervene in this economy acting through the elected Parliament we have put the matter to the the business community of our country that the need for a public sector is one of the elements in a many sided strategy of Economic Development and restructuring that has to be considered by us all including the private sector thec holds no ideological positions which dictate the that it must adopt a policy of nationalization but thec also holds the view that there is no self-regulating mechanism within the South African economy which will on its own ensure growth with Equity at the same time we take it as a given as given that the private sector is an engine of growth and development which is critical to the success of the mixed economy we hope to see in future in the future South Africa we are accordingly committed to the creation of the situation in which business people both South African and foreign have confidence in the security of their Investments are assured of a fair rate of return on their capital and do business in conditions of stability and peace we must also make the point very firmly that the political settlement and democracy itself cannot survive unless the material needs of the people the bread and butter issues are addressed as part of the process of change and as a matter of urgency it should never be that the anger of the poor should be the finger of accusation pointed at all of us because we fail to respond to the crisis of the people for food to the cries of the people for food for shelter for the dignity of the individual we shall need your support to achieve the post apartheid economic objectives which are an intrinsic part of the process of the restoration of the human rights of the people of South Africa we would like to approach the issue of our economic cooperation not as a relationship between donor and recipient between a dependent and a benefactor we would like to believe that there is a way in which we could structure this relationship so that we do indeed benefit from your enormous resources in terms of your Capital technology all round expertise your enterprising spirit and your markets this relationship should however be one from which your people should also derive benefit so that we we who are fighting to live Liberate the very Spirit of our entire people from the bondage of the arrogance of the ideology and practice of white supremacy do not build a relationship of subset dependency and forging gratitude one of the benefits that should acre to both our peoples and to the rest of the world should surely be that this complex South African society which has known nothing but racism for three centuries should be transformed into an oasis of good race relations where the black shall to the white be sister and brother a fellow South African an equal human being both citizens of the world to destroy racism in the world we together must expanse apartheid racism in South Africa Justice and Liberty must be our tool prosperity and happiness our weapon Mr Speaker distinguished representatives of the American people you know this more than we do that peace is its own reward our own fate born by a succession of generations that reach backwards into centuries has been nothing but tension conflict and death in a sense we do not know the meaning of Peace except in the imagination but because we have not known true peace in its real meaning because for centuries Generations have had to bury the victims of State violence we have fought for the right to experience speace on the initiative of thec the process towards the conclusion of a peaceful settlement has started according to a logic dictated by our situation we are engaged in an effort which includes the removal of obstacles to negotiation this will be followed by a negotiated determination of the mechanism which will draw up the new con Constitution this should lead to the formation of this constitution making institution and therefore the elaboration and Adoption of a democratic Constitution elections would then be held on the basis of this Constitution and for the first time South Africa would have a body of lawmakers which would like yourselves be mandated by the whole people despite the admitted commitment of President de cler to walk this road with us and despite our acceptance of his integrity and honesty of his purposes we would be fools to believe that the road ahead of us is without major headles too many among our white compatriots are spped in the ideology of racism to admit easily that change must come tragedy May yet s the future we pray and work for if these slaves of the past take take up arms in a desperate effort to resist the process which must lead to the Democratic transformation of our country for those who care to worry about violence in our country and as we do it is at these forces that they should focus their attention a process in which we are engaged we must contend still with the reality that South Africa is a country in the grip of the apartheid crime against humanity the consequences of this continue to be felt not only within our borders but throughout southern Africa which continues to harvest the bitter fruits of conflict and War especially in mosmi and Angola peace will not come to our country and region until the apartheid system is  ended therefore we say we still have a struggle on our hands our common and Noble efforts to abolish the system of white minority domination must continue we are encouraged and strengthened by the fact of the agreement between ourselves this Congress as well as President Bush and his administration that sanctions remain in  place sanctions should remain in place because the purpose for which they were imposed has not yet been  achieved we have yet to arrive at the point when we can say that South Africa is set on an irreversible cost leading to its transformation into a United Democratic and non-racial Country we plead we plead that you seed the prerogative to the people of South Africa to determine the moment when it will be said that Prof Prof found changes have occurred and an irreversible process achieved enabling you and the rest of the International Community to lift sanctions we would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the principal struggle you waged which resulted in the adoption of the historic comprehensive anti-app appointed act which made such a decisive contribution to the process of moving our country forward towards negotiations we request that you go further and assist us with the material resources which will enable us to promote the peace process and meet other needs which arise from the changing situ ation you have helped to bring about the stand you took established the understanding among the millions of our people that here we have friends here we have Fighters Against Racism who feel hurt because we are hurt who seek our success because they too seek the victory of democracy over tyranny and here I speak not only about you members of the United States Congress but also of the millions of people throughout this great land who stood up and engaged the apartheid system in struggle   the mes who have given us such strength and Joy by the manner in which they have received us since we arrived in this country Mr Speaker Mr President as senators and representatives we went to jail because it was impossible to still to sit still while the obscenity of the apartheid system was being imposed on our   people it would have been immoral to keep quiet while a racist tyranny sought to reduce an entire people into a status worse than that of the beasts of the forest it would have been an act of treason against the people and against our conscience to allow fear and the drive towards self-preservation to dominate our Behavior obliging us to absent ourselves from the struggle for democracy and human rights not only in our country but throughout the    world we could not have made an acquaintance through literature with human giants such as George Washington Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson had not been moved to act as they were moved to act we could not have heard of and admired John Brown Soldier n truth Frederick Douglas web duor Marcus Garvey Martin Luther King Jr and   we could not have heard of these and not be moved to act as they were moved to act we could not have known of your Declaration of Independence and not elected to join in the struggle to guarantee the people's life liveing and the pursuit of happiness we are grateful to you all that you persisted in your resolve to have us and other political prisoners released from jail you have given us the gift and privilege to rejoin our people yourselves and the rest of the International Community in the common effort to transform South Africa into a United a democratic and non-racial Country you have given us the power to join hands with all people of conscience to fight for the victory of democracy and human rights throughout the world   we are glad that you meed with our own people to make it possible for us to emerge from the darkness of the prison cell and join the Contemporary process of the renewal of the world we thank you most sincerely for all you have done and come count on you to persist in your Noble Endeavors to free the rest of our political prisoners and to emancipate our people from the larger prison that is apartheid South Africa the day may not be found when we will borrow the words of Thomas ston and speak of the will of the South African nation in the exercise of that will by this United Nation of black and white people it must surely be that there will be born a country on the southern tip of Africa which you will be proud to call a friend and an ally because of his contribution to the universal striving towards Liberty human rights prosperity and peace among the people let that day come now let us keep our arms locked together so that we form a solid fance

thank you,First Address to the U.S. Congress,1990/2/12,Youtube
4,Nelson Mandela,"our simple message is that sanctions should be maintained we essential because sanctions were introduced for the purpose of dismantling a patent and of making sure that every South Africa black and white is able to determine his Apartheid is doomed South Africa shall be free It’s struggle continues own future thank you thank you it’s a pleasure  we do not know what the response of the international community is going to be when we call for assistance in building a new South Africa is that the international community has got the resources to help us if they wanted to see a non-racial South Africa after the dismantling of apartheid is natural on the part of businessmen to want to to assure themselves that when Democratic changes take place in a country their investment will be safe there is nothing unusual as far as that is concerned and I think that we have been able from our side to assure them that tell we are keenly aware of the importance of assuring a businessman that their investments will be safe firstly the argument that by companies that it is better for them to remain in South Africa flies in the face companies of the considered opinion of opinion makers in South Africa the decision that companies should be disinvest is that of the political organizations in the country and other democratic formations it is the opinion of the trade union country which guards the interest of the workers themselves it is movement in the country and it is also the opinion of religious organizations in the country and it is the opinion of professional associations what right has any company then in that situation to say it is better for the country for them to remain they are looking at the matter purely from the point of view of their own interests and we don't accept that we have to be guided by the views of people who don't consider the interests of the country but of their own from the point of view of the whole profits One option was suggested by a businessmen this morning of forming a bank which would the channel funds and resources to a new South Africa that is another channel or another option this is not something new those who are followed political developments in our country know and that this is no novel attitude on our part we have made it clear right from the beginning that we are looking at various options state participation is just one of those options well I don't think I have anything to comment well I don't think I have anything to comment about that I have sat satisfactory on this question if you wanted to suggest anything more you are free to do so we don't work on the basis of models we work on the basis of the needs of our people and our country secondly we don't think that is going to be settled overnight it's a matter which will receive proper attention the views of experts on the matter but what we are determined to do is to redress that experts on the matter that imbalance how long it will take will depend on the conditions existing at the time when you address the question this is not a question of personalities the question of discussing with specific groups in the country on the question of the peace process is the responsibility of the organization it makes known the peace process is the responsibility of the organization it makes no difference who is there it is those who are authorized by the organization to take part in that process and it is the organization that is important not individuals secondly we don't think it is in the interests of solutions in South Africa to be publicizing precisely with whom we are discussing and what we said it should be sufficient for you to know that this is one of the problems which we are addressing I do not think in terms of death threats my bosses here have given me sufficient work which occupies my attention from morning to sunset I don't think about death threats at all I have not examined the question whether the people from whom these threats come are beyond repair but one thing I know is that the government itself has created a monster they are the people who have been demonizing the ANC all along they are the people who have trained at the police that their duty is to protect the white minority against the threat they're from the African National Congress and similar organizations so that if they despite the fact that they themselves now believe that there should be a complete change in their policy nevertheless they are dealing now with the monster which they have created and it has to be expected that these threats should be made but again you will be making a mistake if you think that there are people beyond the pale discussions it has been established now that discussions can bring about a fundamental changes in the attitudes of individuals and the meeting that we've held with the government and the whole peace process shows that you can change people's ideas by talking you mean the responsibility of dealing with the monster it is the responsibility of everybody who would think that the country should be mobilizing around the question of peace you must understand first that until apartheid has been dismantled we will continue having problems of the nature you're referring to these problems are essentially the creation of the apartheid system but if you are thinking about the violence that is going on now it is true that the element of black fighting black is there but this is a very unimportant aspect what is worrying us now and the problem before the country is the fact that state organs are being used to encourage and aggravate violence between black and black as I have pointed out on countless occasions in regard to the violence in natal we have put a specific appointed question to de Klerk we have said to him you have a strong efficient and well-equipped police force and army can you tell us why you have allowed for four and a half years violence to continue in which almost 4,000 people have been killed without crushing the violence you have taken no visit of visible steps in order to end this violence what is the reason he has found it very difficult to answer the question we have however provided him with the answer we have served you have now allowed your police to try and eliminate the anc and its membership because you regard that the anc as the main threat to white domination that is your problem and that is why the government has decided not to interfere with the violence that is going on that is the problem that faces us You must remember that these are strategies which were decided by the government almost four years ago even before we decided on the peace process or before we convince them but it was necessary for the government to sit down and talk to us they may now be trying to prevent this but as I have said that they have created a monster which they can no longer control well that is a problem which we have to address but we are putting pressure on the government to do something about it because as long as the government remains inactive conniving at this violence the peace process itself is in danger we are discussing the matter with mr de Klerk that is pressure sufficient enough because we are involved in the peace process and we’re saying to him if you want this you will have to solve this matter well and I don't want to discuss that but we have placed a matter before them the whole issue in South Africa is about one person one vote that is a demand for which the people have paid with their own lives and it is a demand over which there can be no compromise we demanded that the new South Africa and the a solution be the acceptance of the principle of one man one vote but we can't work on the basis of timetables it is sufficient to say that both of the anc as well as the government feel that it is urgent for us to reach a settlement but we can indicate saviors as to when an agreement will be reached it is to repeat sufficient that we are both keen to reach a solution as soon as possible we regard that the maintenance of sanctions the quickest way of helping us to reach a solution that the government has agreed to our demands that we should sit down and talk is partly due to the internal pressure the mass struggles that are being conducted by the peoples of Africa as well as by international pressure and we feel therefore that the maintenance of sanctions will enable us to reach this goal as soon as possible because both the anc as well as the government are worried about the state of our economy we want our economy to function in a healthy we want a healthy economy and we don't want our economy to be shattered by sanctions as is happening today but we as the liberation movement are prepared to face the situation of the economy being had by sanctions in order for us to reach the greater goal of liberating the people of South Africa well you can go and interview sir Edward and find out his reasons for saying so we are not looking at 25 years certainly not we are what oh yes well we are not even looking at 3 to 5 we if we able to do that to reach a solution tonight we will do so well I am NOT a student of politics in a university I do not know what your reasons for saying that it is difficult to get a transformation to a non racial society I would have thought that the example of Namibia shatters that argument altogether because they have been able to establish a non racial society without much difficulty that government of national reconciliation is functioning very well and is supported by all population groups and that to us this is something natural we published our policy document in 1955 and that document is an attack on all forms of racialism we hear the national groups the population groups of South Africa are put on the same status and where we declare any form of racialism a criminal offense this is supported by the people of South Africa we have a substantial number of whites in our movement already who are participating in policy decisions and and participating in full without any discrimination the fact that in our delegation to Cape Town we had all population groups in our country shows how serious we are about a non-racial South Africa which we hope to build we had all population groups whereas that the white delegation was drawn from the whites and from the whites only from the Afrikaners that shows again that we have long been addressing the question of a change from a racial society we don't expect any difficulties about this matter we are not talking about question of strength in the process of negotiation in regard that to the question that you raised all that were concerned with is that the people who are going to negotiate a non-racial Constitution must be properly mandated through democratic elections we say that the people who negotiate should have legitimacy should have credibility so that their decision can enjoy the support of the overwhelming majority of the population that can only be done if there are non racial and democratic elections in the country the attitude of the government they are free to say what they like but they have to defend that in the course of our negotiations and we think that we have a powerful case the man you are talking about were elected elected in inverted commas when the ANC was bent when our political our activists were forced into exile and others thrown into jail when the leadership that was inside the country was good so we have we had no chance whatsoever of participating in elections the only way of deciding who are the leaders we should negotiate is that they should be elected in non-racial elections in the country I think we have got a powerful case which the government can never answer the people themselves have either solved or or are solving that partial you we have a fall of this so-called homeland which are constitutionally legally independent in of this so-called homeland which are constitutionally legally independent in three of these areas in fact in four of them they have been coups in the transkei three of these areas Siskei these coups have led to the establishment of democratic governments which are working with the ANC in a third homeland of understand independent homeland there was another coup which succeeded but the man who led that coup was himself produced by the south african police he wants to see us he wants to discuss with us but of course there are problems in the sense that the people on the ground do not want him because of his record but that there has been a coup in that area in the fourth area more Pretoria again that the people took action and overthrew manga what is this judge named mangope they overthrew him he was installed by South African forces but as far as the people are concerned in his area they overthrew that is the first leg of the statement I have made that the people themselves have solved or are solving that problem then there are six homeland's which are not independent but self-governing five of these are working with the ANC of course the people in this homeland are standing up and fighting against what they consider to be discredited leaders we are saying that we are prepared that to work with his leaders we are prepared to forget the past for the sake of presenting a united front on the question of mobilizing the country for negotiations what was saying to them settle your problems with the people in your areas we are not going to be used as a means that to protect a discredited leaders settle your problems with the people on the ground they are doing so but we are also discussing with them before we went down to Cape Town to see the government we called a meeting of his leaders five of them came and we briefed them on what we were going to discuss with the government after the meeting in Cape Town we again called them and brief him on what transpired in Cape Town and they fully supported this not only that they accepted the anc to use their own terminology as the mouthpiece of the black people in the country so the question of the power of the homeland may be an overstatement because it does not appear to me that they are able to last if we don't want them to exist in this particular situation but that is not necessary to decide because they are now working with us and the world question of the homeland is one that in the light of the new situation of our relations with the homeland leaders will be subject to discussion and negotiation well to me well to me the only solution of the problem in the Middle East is one of peace for the opponents to sit down and hammer out their differences and try to effect a negotiated settlement it is the only solution that is open to the PLO and the Israeli government and I would urge them to do that I was more astonished than surprised you must remember that when in 1960 at leaders like Oliver Tambo and the young men sitting at the back there Thabo Mbeki went out of the country one of the first steps that they took was to visit the West End to ask for assistance in the costs of that visit they came to the United States of America and asked for help they did not get that help they went to Cuba and the Cuba on the spot pledged support and actually gave it long before the West could do anything to assist us I am surprised that anybody should now expect us to condemn Cuba to condemn the PLO which has been working with us right from the beginning and helping us in our problems it is totally unrealistic it is a typical attitude of countries which really do not approach the problem of South Africa from the point of view of the liberation struggle in South Africa which approach these problems from the point of view of their own interest what that view wants is that at the African National Congress and the liberation movement in South Africa should be used for the purpose of conducting vendetta's enemies of the worst we must join that Vendetta in order to advance the interests of the West that we will not do would you please go to the editors of those papers editors of those papers I have not even seen the reports you have kept me so busy that I cannot read the newspaper well I hear it for the first time I am as astonished as I was when this Fuhrer originally arose well the ANC has opened its doors to women in accordance with the declaration that were made to which you have referred in the delegation that went to Cape Town for example there were no less than two women that shows our attitude on this question we will place a no limitations whatsoever on the right of the women to take part in the political activities of the country and of the country and of course in other spheres we will encourage that how this will be done will be determined by the issues that arise if any issues arise which may put obstacles in the path of the women to participate fully in running the country we will deal with it as the problems arise but our policy is perfectly clear and we are already implementing it we are not thinking in terms of individuals we are thinking in terms of ideas and policies what we are saying is that the only solution to the problems of South Africa is the introduction of a non-racial Society if mr de Klerk takes advantage of the four years in which he is still going to remain in power and extends that a vote to all South Africans then the idea for which the National Party and the anc are working that idea then will be a shot of success and and all those who stand for that idea will be in an invincible position and the right will be rendered completely useless that is the message we are putting forward the president of the new South Africa might be Oliver Tambo it might be de Klerk it might be Thabo Mbeki there or mr. sisulu that is that rests on the people of South Africa themselves Well that is a very important question South Africa because of its developed economic system and other infrastructures could be the powerhouse not only of our region but of the greater part of Africa a liberated South Africa would in the first place be a member of sadc which is already examining the question of pulling the resources in our region so that the old region should profit from those pull or pull resources well I'm sure Sadc is known to most of the people here please don't despise them we haven't thank you very much for assisting me and uh the potential is that the potential is that the potential which would immediately be developed by a liberated South Africa joining subject is tremendous is immeasurable and that would stimulate economic development in our region and possibly in Africa but we don't wanted to overstate the benefits that would derive from a liberated South Africa joining Sadc because most of the that would derive from most of the problems of Africa it must be remembered it must always be remembered a legacy of the colonial days and because Africa has not got sufficient resources it's going to take years and even or even generations before they can overcome those legacies but a liberated South Africa can play an important role in the economic development of our region as well as parts of Africa I’m very sorry to well your question is a very broad one I can understand the trend but I may miss the exact point on which you want comment as I understand it the two superpowers the USA and the Soviet Union are now busy trying to throw the Cold War they are busy on the question of promoting international peace they seem to have come to an understanding that that there must be no conflict between them on specific problems in particular regions and at least at the two leaders today a president kobachov and President George Bush they seem to be addressing the problems of the world very seriously and also making progress and I hope that by the time South Africa gets liberated we will not have to worry about these problems at all well I don't know it has been said that the changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe will mean that said that the West will now be concerned with investing in those countries and that there will be lots of no sufficient funds to help in developing South Africa I hope this is not a case it is of course quite correct for the west to try and assist the countries in Eastern Europe who have got problems of their own but we hope that will not be at the expense of assisting in developing a non-racial South Africa after apartheid has been dismantled well our main message is the maintenance of sanctions by the international community in general and by the United States in particular and that is the message that we are going to give that is the requestor that we are going to make to President Bush our new meeting we are also concerned about the we are also concerned about the rehabilitation of the almost 20,000 political exiles who have to come back to the country will require housing and jobs and educational facilities for their children we are also rebuilding the African National Congress which has been banned over 30 years and this is a very difficult task because however much success we are having in rallies and public meetings and we are drawing the crowds which have never been seen in the history of the country but if those crowds are not a functioning through a disciplined and organized political struggle where there is a machinery through which they can be reached we can fail very badly in our aims and objectives and it becomes necessary therefore for us to have the resources to rebuild the ANC but even more equally important is the fact that we are now mobilizing the whole country for peace that is a task which now puts us as the anc in a totally different category from what that in which we were regarded many people regarded us as a political party pure and simple and they refused to assist because of this Approach in fact we have never been a political party we have always been a political organization we have always been a parliament of the black people in this country where people from different walks of life and with different political affiliations are members of the organization joined only by the determination to oppose a racial oppression now I am going to ask the people of the United States to give us resources to be able to meet these needs and to carry out these duties we are also faced with the question of young people leaving the country because of the state of black education which is far inferior to that of the white and they are seeing their compatriots in the neighboring states receiving better education that they receive in their own country then of course there's the question of violence and all these have fostered large numbers of our young people to leave the country in search of education abroad in the schools established by the ANC but we have not got the resources and would like the people of the United States to help in this regard because we will be equipping our youth for their duties as future leaders Why not why not we do not want to discriminate what I will ask President Bush I will do that directly to him and you can ask me that question of the dignity well I don't think I've got any anxieties at all I am of course anxious that a settlement be reached as soon as possible in our country but I am optimistic that our hopes are not in vain and that the efforts the success of which we have received so far especially having regard that the first meeting between the anc and the government has raised our hopes that even in the more difficult phase where we will now be negotiating for a non-racial Constitution that we might weigh to make a progress which will enable us to reach a solution as soon as possible well we will look at the way in which the United States has handled these problems we are aware of the complaints by black leaders in this country that they are not getting their rights which are guaranteed in the American Constitution we are aware of complaints of that here racialism still exists in this country our own position is very clear we condemn a racialism wherever it is to be founded the world and we sympathize with the stand by black leaders in this country in demanding that they should be able to take advantage of the rights which the law gives them we stand fully behind them in that regard we will however look at the way in which America has tried to solve its problems including the question of racialism in its constitution and any provision which including the question of racialism in its constitution and any provision which makes it possible for the government to eliminate racialism will be useful to us and that is what we will do we'll look at the Constitution's of many countries that of offer the United States of America Thank you very much it is a pleasure",1990 Day after Koppel interview,1990/6/27,Youtube
5,Nelson Mandela,dear friends comrades and fellow south africans i greet you all in the name of peace democracy and freedom for all i stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you the people your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today i therefore a place the remaining years of my life in your hands on this day of my release i extend my sincere and warmest gratitude to the millions of my companions and those in every corner of the globe who have campaigned tirelessly for my release i extend special greetings to the people of cape town this city to which we should build my home for three decades your mass matches and other forms of struggle have served as a constant source of strength to all political prisoners i salute the african national congress it has fulfilled our every expectation in its role as leader of the great match to freedom i salute our president comrade oliver tumble for leading the anc even under the most difficult circumstances i salute the rank and file members of the anc you have sacrificed life and name in the pursuit of the noble cause of our struggle on this occasion we thank the world we thank the world community for their great contribution to the anti-apartheid struggle without your support our struggle would not have reached this advanced stage the sacrifice of the front line states will be remembered by south africans forever my salutations will be incomplete without expressing my deep appreciation for the stranger given to me during my long and lonely years in prison by my beloved wife and family i am convinced that your pain and suffering was far greater than my own before i grow any further i wish to make the point that i intend making only a few preliminary combats at the stage i will make a more complete statement only after i have had the opportunity to consult with my comrades today the majority of south africans black and white recognize that apartheid has no future it has to be ended by our own decisive mass action in order to build peace and security the mass campaigns of defiance and other actions of our organization and people can only call me in the establishment of democracy the apartheid destruction on our subcontinent is incalculable the fabric of family life of millions of my people has been shattered millions are homeless and unemployed our economy our economy lies in ruins and our people are embroiled in political strife our resort to the armed struggle in 1960 with the formation of the military wing of the anc home contour west israel was a purely defensive action against the violence of about it the factors which necessitated the armed struggle still exists today we have no option but to continue we express the hope that a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement would be created soon so that they may no longer be the need for the armed struggle i am a lawyer and disciplined member of the african national congress i am therefore in full agreement with all of its objectives strategies and tactics the need to unite the people of our country is as important a task now as it always has been no individual leader is able to take on his enormous tasks on his own it is our task as leaders to place our views before our organization and to allow the democratic structures to decide on the way forward on the question of democratic practice i feel duty-bound to make the point that a leader of the movement is a person who has been democratically elected at a national conference this is the principle which must be a held without any exception our struggle has reached a decisive moment we call on our people to seize this moment so that the process towards democracy is rapid and uninterrupted we have waited too long for our freedom we can no longer wait now is the time to intensify this treasure on all fronts to relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive the site of fedor looming on the horizon should encourage us to redouble our efforts it is only through disciplined mass action that our victory can be assured we call on our white compatriots to join us in the shaping of a new south africa the freedom movement is the political home for you too we call on the international community to continue the campaign to isolate the apartheid regime to lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process towards the complete eradication of a party our march to freedom is irreversible we must not allow fear to stand in our way universal suffrage on a common voter's role in a united democratic and non-racial south africa is the only way to peace and racial harmony in conclusion i wish to go to my own words during my trial in 1964. they are as true today as they were then i quote i have fought against white domination and i have fought against black domination i have cherished the idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and and with equal opportunities it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to achieve but if needs be it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die,Nation address after prison release,1990/2/11,Youtube

7,Nelson Mandela, Hi how are you it will forever remain an indelible blight on human history that the apartheid crime ever occur it will forever remain an accusation and a challenge to all men and women of conscience that it took as long as it has before all of us stood up to say enough is enough the date for the demise of the white minority regime has been determined agreed and set 7 months from now on April 27 1994 all the people of of South Africa without discriminations on ground of a agenda race color or belief will join in the historic Act of electing a government of their choice when distinguished leaders came together half a century ago to consign to the Past a war that had ped human against itself the ruins and the smoke from the dying fires were the monument to what should not have been the United Nations has to reassess its role redefine its profile and reshape its structures it should truly reflect the diversity of our universe and ensure Equity among the nations in the exercise of power within the system of international relations in general and the security Council in particular and it's also are you are you all right when you have become an American now I just came for your VIs [Applause] the very right to be human is denied every day to hundreds of millions of people as a result of poverty and the unavailability of basic necessities such as food jobs water and shelter Education Health Care and a healthy environment as I sit in Kuno my Village and grow as ancient as it Hills I will continue to entertain the hope that there has emerged a cater of leaders in my own country and region on my continent and in the world which will not allow that any should be denied their freedom as we were that any should be turned into refuges as we were that any should be condemned to go hungry as we were that any should be stripped of their human dignity as we were you have made my day now,Speech at the UN,2010/7/16,Youtube
8,Nelson Mandela,"Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker, President of the Senate and Deputy President, Deputy Presidents, Chief Justice, distinguished members of the National Assembly and the Senate, Provincial Premiers, Commanders of the Security Forces, members of the Diplomatic Corps, esteemed guests, comrades, ladies and gentlemen.  The time will come when our nation will honor the memory of all the sons, the daughters, the mothers, the fathers, the youth and the children who, by their thoughts and deeds, gave us the right to assert with pride that we are South Africans, that we are Africans and that we are citizens of the world.
The certainties that come with age tell me that among these we shall find an Afrikaner woman who transcended a particular experience and became a South African, an African and a citizen of the world.
Her name is Ingrid Jonker.
She was both a poet and a South African. She was both an Afrikaner and an African. She was both an artist and a human being.
In the midst of despair, she celebrated hope. Confronted with death, she asserted the beauty of life.
In the dark days when all seemed hopeless in our country, when many refused to hear her resonant voice, she took her own life.
To her and others like her, we owe a debt to life itself. To her and others like her, we owe a commitment to the poor, the oppressed, the wretched and the despised.
In the aftermath of the massacre at the anti-pass demonstration in Sharpeville she wrote that:
""The child is not dead
the child lifts his fists against his mother
who shouts Africa!...
The child is not dead
Not at Langa nor at Nyanga
nor at Orlando nor at Sharpeville
nor at the police post at Philippi
where he lies with a bullet through his brain...
the child is present at all assemblies and law-giving
the child peers through the windows of houses
and into the hearts of mothers
this child who only wanted to play in the sun at Nyanga
is everywhere
the child grown to a man treks on through all Africa
the child grown to a giant journeys
over the whole world
without a pass!""
And in this glorious vision, she instructs that our endeavors  must be about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child.
It is these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and to give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government.
And so we must, constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens, seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.
The government I have the honor to lead and I dare say the masses who elected us to serve in this role, are inspired by the single vision of creating a people-centered society.
Accordingly, the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfillment, the continuous extension of the frontiers of the freedom.
The acid test of the legitimacy of the programs we elaborate, the government institutions we create, the legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these objectives.
Our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual.
We must construct that people-centered society of freedom in such a manner that it guarantees the political and the human rights of all our citizens.
As an affirmation of the government's commitment to an entrenched human rights culture, we shall immediately take steps to inform the Secretary General of the United Nations that we will subscribe to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
We shall take steps to ensure that we accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Social and Economic Rights and other human rights instruments of the United Nations.
Our definition of the freedom of the individual must be instructed by the fundamental objective to restore the human dignity of each and every South African.
This requires that we speak not only of political freedoms.
My government's commitment to create a people-centered society of liberty binds us to the pursuit of the goals of freedom from want, freedom from hunger, freedom from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom from suppression and freedom from fear.
These freedoms are fundamental to the guarantee of human dignity. They will therefore constitute part of the centerpiece of what this government will seek to achieve, the focal point on which our attention will be continuously focused.
The things we have said constitute the true meaning, the justification and the purpose of the Reconstruction and Development Program, without which it would lose all legitimacy.
When we elaborated this Program we were inspired by the hope that all South Africans of goodwill could join together to provide a better life for all. We were pleased that other political organizations announced similar aims.
Today, I am happy to announce that the Cabinet of the Government of National Unity has reached consensus not only on the broad objective of the creation of the people-centered society of which I have spoken, but also on many elements of a plan broadly based on that Program for Reconstruction and Development.
Let me indicate some of the more important agreements. Annually, in the combined budgets of central government and the provinces, we will provide for an increasing amount of funding for the plan.
This will start with an appropriation of R2,5 billion in the 1994/95 budget that will be presented next month. This should rise to more than R10 billion by the fifth year of the life of this government.
Government will also use its own allocation of funds to the Reconstruction and Development Plan to exert maximum leverage in marshaling funds from within South Africa and abroad.
In this regard, I am pleased to report that we have been holding consultation with some of the principal business leaders of our country.
Consequently, we are assured that the business sector can and will make a significant contribution towards the structuring and management of such reconstruction and development funds, towards the effective identification and implementation of projects and by supporting the financing of the socio-economic development effort.
I am also pleased to report that many of our friends abroad have already made commitments to assist us to generate the reconstruction and development funds we need.
We thank them most sincerely for their positive attitude which arises not from objectives of charity but from the desire to express solidarity with the new society we seek to build.
We accept the duty of coordinating the management of the total resources that will be generated, without seeking to prescribe to other contributors or undermining the continued role of non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations.
The initial R2,5 billion will be found from savings and the redirection of spending, as included in the preliminary 1994/95 budget proposals presented to Cabinet.
I would like to thank the departments of state for their cooperation in carrying out this adjustment to their planning, at short notice.
As we allocate larger amount in future, we shall require further adjustments by departments, partly to correct the bias in the spending patterns which are a legacy of the past.
The longer period shall allow such changes to be properly planned. But they will still make great demands on the managerial capacity and spirit of cooperation of the Cabinet and the whole civil service.
We are confident that, motivated by the desire to serve the people, the public service will discharge its responsibilities with diligence, sensitivity and enthusiasm, among other things paying attention to the important goal of increasing efficiency and productivity.
My government is equally committed to ensure that we use this longer period properly fully to bring into the decision-making processes organs of civil society.
This will include the trade union movement and civic organizations, so that at no time should the government become isolated from the people. At the same time, steps will be taken to build the capacity of communities to manage their own affairs.
Precisely because we are committed to ensuring sustainable growth and development leading to a better life for all, we will continue existing programs of fiscal rehabilitation.
We are therefore determined to make every effort to contain real general government consumption at present levels and to manage the budget deficit with a view to its continuous reduction.
Similarly, we are agreed that a permanently higher general level of taxation is to be avoided.
To achieve these important objectives will require consistent discipline on the part of both the central and the provincial governments.
Furthermore, this disciplined approach will ensure that we integrate the objectives of our Reconstruction and Development Plan within government expenditure and not treat them as incidental to the tasks of government, marginalized to the status of mere additions to the level of expenditure.
There are major areas of desperate need in our society.
As a signal of its seriousness to address these, the government will, within the next 100 days, implement various projects under the direct supervision of the President. Let me briefly mention these.
Children under the age of six and pregnant mothers will receive free medical care in every state hospital and clinic where such need exists. Similarly, a nutritional feeding scheme will be implemented in every primary school where such need is established. A concrete process of consultation between the major stakeholders in this area will be organized immediately.
A program is already being implemented to electrify 350 000 homes during the current financial year.
A campaign will be launched at every level of government, a public works program designed and all efforts made to involve the private sector, organized labour, the civics and other community organizations to rebuild our townships, restore services in rural and urban areas, while addressing the issue of job creation and training, especially for our unemployed youth.
Many details of the overall reconstruction and development plan remain to be discussed, agreed and put in place. But I believe that the broad outline I have given and the immediate initiatives I have mentioned, will allow you to share my joy at the progress already made by the Government of National Unity with regard to this important matter.
We shall carry out this plan within the context of a policy aimed at building a strong and growing economy which will benefit all our people.
I would like to deal with a few matters in this regard.
In support of sustainable economic growth and the macro-economic objective of Government, it will remain the primary objective of monetary policy to promote and maintain overall financial stability.
The Reserve Bank has the important function of protecting the value of our currency and striving for relative price stability at all times.
We are pleased that Dr Chris Stals will continue to serve as Governor of the Reserve Bank.
The battle to reduce the rate of inflation will continue. The realization of many of our objectives for a fair and equal treatment of all our people will not be possible unless we succeed in avoiding high inflation in the economy.
We also face a major challenge in re-entering the global economy, while stable prices are vital to the restructuring of our industries and dealing with the critical issue of job-creation.
We are blessed with a heritage of a sophisticated financial sector. Our financial markets are well-placed to play an important part in the allocation of scarce funds to give effect to our economic development program.
It is however also necessary that we think in new ways, to meet the challenges of reconstruction and development.
We therefore welcome recent developments that provide for the creation of community banks. We would also like to encourage the greater participation of established financial institutions in the important area of black economic empowerment and support for the development of small and medium business.
The latter two areas of economic activity will receive the greatest attention of the Government because of their importance in deracialinisg and democratizing the economy and creating the jobs which our people need.
We pay attention to the important matter of consumer protection to shield the ordinary people of our country from unscrupulous business practices.
We must also clear that we must pay increased attention to tourism. The jobs and foreign currency which tourism generates will strongly influence our economy.
The active and imaginative intervention of all stake stakeholders in this area of our national life must take advantage of the excellent atmosphere created by our peaceful transition to democracy to make tourism a major positive force in the future.
We look forward to the private sector as a whole playing a central role in achieving the significantly high and sustainable rates of economic growth.
We are convinced that the growth prospects of this sector will be enhanced by the measures of fiscal discipline contained in our approach to the Reconstruction and Development Program and by the continued steady course of monetary policy.
As growth proceeds, more domestic savings will progressively become available to finance increased investment at reasonable rates of interest.
The Government is also acutely conscious of the fact that we should work firstly to return the capital account of the balance of payments to equilibrium and, in due course, to ensure a net inflow of resources, consistent with the experience of other countries that enjoy more rapid growth rates.
The present situation of a dual currency and the existence of an exchange control apparatus is a direct result of the conflict in which our country was embroiled in the past.
As the situation returns to normal, these arrangements will be subjected to critical scrutiny. It should be possible to match the steady growth of confidence at home and abroad with other confidence enhancing modifications to everybody's benefit.
The Government will also address all other matters that relate the creation of an attractive investment climate for both domestic and foreign investors, conscious of the fact that we have to compete with the rest of the world in terms of attracting, in particular, foreign direct investment.
I am pleased that we have already started to address the important question of our trade policy, guided by our GATT commitments and the determination systematically to open the economy to global competition in a carefully managed process.
Soon we will also begin trade negotiations with, among others, the European Union, the United States, our partners in the Southern African Customs Unions and our neighbors in the Southern African Development Community to provide a stable and mutually beneficial framework for our international economic relations.
We will also be looking very closely at the question of enhancing South-South cooperation in general as part of the effort to expand our economic links with the rest of the world.
Consistent with our objective of creating a people-centered society and effectively to address the critical questions of growth, reconstruction and development, we will, together with organized labour and the private sector, pay special attention to the issue of human resource development.
Both the public and the private sectors will be encouraged to regard labour as a resource and not a cost. Education and training must therefore be looked at very closely to ensure that we empower the workers, raise productivity levels and meet the skills needs of a modern economy.
Important work will have to be done in and significant resources devoted to the areas of science and technology, including research and development.
Government is also convinced that organized labour is an important partner whose cooperation is crucial for the reconstruction and development of our country.
That partnership requires, among other things, that our labour law be reformed so that it is in line with international standards, apartheid vestiges are removed and a more harmonious labour relations dispensation is created, on the basis of tripartite cooperation between government, labour and capital.
The Government is determined forcefully to confront the scourge of unemployment, not by way of handouts but by the creation of work opportunities.
The Government will also deal sensitively with the issue of population movements into the country, to protect our workers, to guard against the exploitation of vulnerable workers and to ensure friendly relations with all countries and peoples.
The Government is also taking urgent measures to deal firmly with drug trafficking some of which is carried out by foreign nationals who are resident in the country.
We must end racism in the workplace as part of our common offensive against racism in general. No more should words like Kaffirs, Hottentots, Coolies, Boy, Girl and Baas be part of our vocabulary.
I also trust that the matter of paying the workers for the public holidays proclaimed in order to ensure their participation in the elections and the inauguration ceremonies will now be resolved as a result of recent consultations.
This would be a welcome demonstration by the private sector of its involvement in the beautiful future we are all trying to build.
We have devoted time to a discussion of economic questions because they are fundamental to the realization of the fundamental objectives of the reconstruction and development program.
Below I mention some of the work in which the relevant governments are already involved to translate these objectives into reality.
The Government will take steps to ensure the provision of clean water on the basis of the principle of water security for all and the introduction of proper sanitation sensitive to the protection of the environment.
We are determined to address the dire housing shortage in a vigorous manner, acting together with the private sector and the communities in need of shelter.
Health also remains a fundamental building block of the humane society we are determined to create through the implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Program.
We must address the needs of the aged and disabled, uplift disadvantaged sectors such as the women and the youth, and improve the lives of our people in the rural communities and the informal settlements.
We must invest substantial amounts in education and training and meet our commitment to introduce free and compulsory education for a period of at least 9 years. Everywhere we must reinculcate the culture of learning and of teaching and make it possible for this culture to thrive.
We must combat such social pathologies as widespread poverty, the break down of family life, crime, alcohol and drug abuse, the abuse of children, women and the elderly and the painful reality of street children. We are giving urgent attention to the long waiting lists for the payment of social grants which have developed in some areas, owing to lack of funds.
I am especially pleased that we have a ministry dedicated to the issue of the environment. Its work must impact on many aspects of national activity and address the question of the well-being of society as a whole and the preservation of a healthy environmental future even for generation not yet born.
As we began this address, we borrowed the words of Ingrid Jonker to focus on the plight of the children our country.
I would now like to say that the Government will, as a matter of urgency, attend to the tragic and complex question of children and juveniles in detention and prison.
The basic principle from which we will proceed from now onwards is that we must rescue the children of the nation and ensure that the system of criminal justice must be the very last resort in the case of juvenile offenders.
I have therefore issued instruction to the Departments concerned, as a matter of urgency, to work out the necessary guidelines which will enable us to empty our prisons of children and to place them in suitable alternative care. This is in addition to an amnesty for various categories serving prisoners as will be effected in terms of what I said in my Inauguration Address two week ago.
In this context, I also need to make the point that the Government will also not delay unduly with regard to attending to the vexed and unresolved issue of an amnesty for criminal activities carried out in furtherance of political objectives.
We will attend to this matter in a balanced and dignified way. The nation must come to terms with its past in a spirit of openness and forgiveness and proceed to build the future on the basis of repairing and healing.
The burden of the past lies heavily on all of us, including those responsible for inflicting injury and those who suffered.
Following the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, we will prepare the legislation which will seek to free the wrongdoers from fear of retribution and blackmail, while acknowledging the injury of those who have been harmed so that the individual wrongs, injuries, fears and hopes affecting individuals are identified and attended to.
In the meantime, summoning the full authority of the position represent, we call on all concerned not to take any steps that might, in any way, impede or compromise the processes of reconciliation which the impending legislation will address.
The problem of politically motivated violence is still with us. We depend on our country's security forces to deal with this problem using all resources at their disposal. In this, and in their efforts to deal especially criminal violence, they have our personal support and confidence.
We have also directed that all relevant ministries should engage the structures set up in terms of the National Peace Accord so that these can be invigorated to pursue their noble mission in the context of the changed circumstances in our country.
The Government will otherwise not spare any effort in ensuring that our security forces enjoy the standing they deserve of being accepted by all our people the defenders of our sovereignty, our democratic system, the guarantors of a just peace within the country and the safety and security of all citizens and their property.
Let met also take this opportunity to reiterate our assurance to the rest of the public service that the Government is firmly committed to the protection of the rights of all members of this service.
We are also determined to work with the organizations of the service to ensure that we have the democratic, non-racial, non-sexist, honest and accountable corps of public servants which members of the Public Service themselves desire.
In this context, we must also make the observation that the Government will not waver from the principle of achieving parity in remuneration and conditions of service among all workers in the public sector.
The youth of our country are the valued possession of the nation. Without them there can be no future. Their needs are immense and urgent. They are at the centre of our reconstruction and development plan.
To address them, acting with the youth themselves, the Government will engage the representative organizations of the youth and other formations, among other things to look at the siting of a broad-based National Commission on Youth Development among the structures of Government.
Building on this base, the Government and the Commission would then work together to ensure that the nurturing of our youth stands at the centre of our reconstruction and development, without being consigned to a meaningless ghetto of public life.
Similar considerations must attach to the equally important question of the emancipation of the women of our country.
It is vitally important that all structures of Government, including the President himself, should understand this fully that freedom cannot be achieved unless the women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.
All of us must take this on board that the objectives of the Reconstruction and Development Program will not have been realized unless we see in visible and practical terms that the condition of the women of our country has radically changed for the better and that they have been empowered to intervene in all aspects of life as equals with any other member of society.
In addition to the establishment of the statutory Gender Commission provided for in the Constitution, the Government will, together with the representatives of the women themselves, look at the establishment of organs of Government to ensure that all levels of the public sector, from top to bottom, integrate the central issue of the emancipation of women in their programs and daily activities.
Tomorrow, on Africa Day, the dream of Ingrid Jonker will come to fruition. The child grown to a man will trek through all Africa. The child grown to a journey will journey over the whole world - without a pass!
Tomorrow, on Africa Day, our new flag will be hoisted in an historic ceremony at the OAU Headquarters in Addis Ababa, with the OAU having already agreed to accept us as its latest member.
Tomorrow, on Africa Day, the UN Security Council will meet to lift the last remaining sanctions against South Africa and to position the world organization to relate to our country as an honored, responsible and peace-loving citizen.
As such, the Government is involved in discussion to determine what our contribution could be to the search for peace in Angola and Rwanda, to the reinforcement of the peace process in Mozambique, to the establishment of a new world order of mutually beneficial cooperation, justice, prosperity and peace for ourselves and for the nations of the world.
Yesterday the Cabinet also decided to apply for our country to join the Commonwealth. This important community of nations is waiting to receive us with open arms.
We have learnt the lesson that our blemishes speak of what all humanity should not do. We understand this fully that our glories point to the heights of what human genius can achieve.
In our dreams we have a vision of all our country at play in our sports fields and enjoying deserved and enriching recreation in our theaters, galleries, beaches, mountains, plains and game parks, in conditions of peace, security and comfort.
Our road to that glorious future lies through collective hard work to accomplish the objective of creating a people-centered society through the implementation of the vision contained in our reconstruction and development plan.
Let us all get down to work!",1994 State of the Nation Address,1994/5/24,SA Government
9,Nelson Mandela,"Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly; honorable Chairperson and Deputy Chairpersons of the National Council of Provinces; honorable Members of Parliament; Distinguished guests; Ladies and Gentlemen:
I should start by expressing my appreciation for this opportunity to exchange views with you at the beginning of this penultimate sitting of our first democratic parliament.
I wish all of you a productive New Year in the service of the people.
As government, we are confident of the progress being made to meet our mandate. We are resolved to build on the solid foundation that has been laid over the past three-and-a-half years. As always, the most critical challenge is whether we are succeeding as leaders to mobilize the people in actual practice to be their own liberators.
We know too well that on our own we cannot succeed. We know that the programs of government are not the panacea for all the ills of our terrible past. They are but a platform for South Africans to let their strengths shine through.
By our own pronouncements and actions, we could relate to these citizens as passive recipients of government delivery, as if government were a force on high. Worse still, we could turn some constituents into passive critics, their own rationality drowned in the chorus of regret that the past has passed. On both counts, this would be a recipe for sure failure.
That is why, during the course of last year, we once again put the Masakhane campaign at the centre of our activities. And our performance should be judged above all on the basis of whether our programs are positively affecting the lives of especially the most vulnerable sections of society: the poor, women, the disabled, children and the rural masses - the primary victims of the iniquitous system from which we have just emerged. We are proud to answer this question in the affirmative.
Last year, we increased the supply of clean and accessible water from 700 thousand to 1,3 million South Africans.
We have surpassed our plans to build or upgrade 500 clinics last year; and the primary school feeding scheme reaches 4,9-million children.
From 250 thousand in 1996, we are in line to make 421 thousand telephone connections this financial year, making life that much easier for millions of South Africans.
With more than 400 thousand electricity connections in 1997 alone, today South Africa has reached a 58% electrification level so millions can have light.
Besides the impressive land redistribution programs, the law on secure tenure will bring more certainty in the lives of over six million citizens.
There is no magic in numbers as such. But we are proud that, through these and many other projects, our programs are impacting on the lives of particularly the poor. This applies to varying degrees with regard to other challenges to which we shall later return.
And it is all a result of a clear strategy, properly managed plans, good governance and, more than anything else, the determination of the overwhelming majority of our country-men and -women to change their lives for the better. It is therefore understandable that, unlike some of us, those who bore the brunt of apartheid oppression say that things are a lot better.
But they also say, and are justified to say so, that what has been done is not enough. Not because they expect the legacy of centuries of colonialism to be eradicated in a few years, as we ourselves have said on countless occasions before. Not because they are frustrated with government. But because they appreciate that together we need to much more, over many years, to realize a truly just and prosperous government, they have a serious, committed and caring institution - a government that they can call their own.
We are at the beginning of an arduous and protracted struggle for a better quality of life. In the course of this struggle, we shall have immediate successes; we shall have setbacks; but we shall certainly progress, inch by inch, towards our goal.
From time to time, incidents do happen which bring out in bold relief the enormity of the challenges we face. As the saying goes, one falling tree makes more noise than millions that are growing. As such, for both good reason and bad, occasional problems are seized upon by our detractors as the stock-in-trade of this government; indeed as the essence of democracy.
I will raise a few of them, particularly, difficulties with regard to old age pensions, education, crime and corruption, housing and job-creation, because they touch on the very essence of the issues of resources to meet our obligations, the size of the public service and its management, civic duty and a new morality.
Madame Speaker;
A few weeks ago, the problem of disbursement of old age pensions and other social grants came to the fore.
Let me start off by saying that, in the way that we increased old age pensions last year, and as we eliminate fraud, we shall seek to find resources this year for a further increase - modest as it may be - working towards a life of dignity for our senior citizens. Let me further emphasize that we are committed - not merely because of statutory obligations, but because we care - to ensure that, whatever the occasional administrative hiccups, the right to a pension will always be met.
What has not received much public coverage is the fact that the problems we experienced recently derived from:
* Firstly, that the audit of our newly integrated system is not only eliminating ""ghosts""; but it also identified people who were callously refused these pensions under the apartheid system and its bantustan off-shoots. They are today on the roll; and it was decided that their right to back-pay could not be disregarded.
* Secondly, the measures that have been taken to eliminate corruption have uncovered many fraudsters in the government machinery, but we still have a long way to go to resolve this problem.
* Thirdly, some public servants are, to put it mildly, not imbued with the spirit of public service - to the extent that even in instances where these funds are available, they do not turn up on time and/or they relate to senior citizens with attitudes bordering on the criminal.
Through co-operation between national and provincial movements concerned, we shall ensure that these problems are dealt with methodically and with a ruthless determination.
Related to this, we did indicate last year that we expected some teething problems in the first year of total budget allocations to the provinces. Indeed, we need to pause here, to pay tribute to the provincial administrations, which were able to come through without debilitating desolation. Given the serious problems identified by central government Task Teams last year, it is thanks to the efforts of all provinces without exception that the problems have not been much worse. But we must eliminate overspending.
A related and critical matter is the issue of how the public resources at our disposal correspond with the social backlog that we have inherited.
In our view, the starting point in addressing the question of the national budget and public finances in general is that we cannot behave like fools who cut their noses to spite their faces: to throw policy out of the window in search of fractions of percentages in deficit targets. We have creatively to strive to meet our obligations within the context of a reduction of the public debt.
Indeed, we cannot pretend that the deficit targets we have set ourselves do not test our capacity and will. But we cannot divert from the course we have chosen. There is no other route to sustainable development.
Two critical matters arise from this.
In the first two years of our democracy, we sought to use the special mechanism of a so-called RDP Fund to lever changes in the patterns of departmental spending. Today this task is built into the normal functions of all departments. Reprioritization and more reprioritization is the challenge that we shall continue to grapple with in the coming years.
For if we should not and cannot cut down on houses and clinics being built, on the supply of water, on improving the quality of education including the building and equipping of schools, on improving policing and so on, then we have to cut down elsewhere.
There have been some commendable savings from better cash flow management. But it is not nearly enough.
And we cannot use the proceeds of privatization to fund salaries and other consumption expenditure.
Put in simple terms, we need to cut spending on personnel.
I am confident that all of us, and the trade union movement in particular, will agree that apartheid South Africa was over-governed and over-supervised. The size of the public service had nothing to do with public service.
On the other hand, democratic governance is management of a process whereby people govern themselves. Government is not an employment agency.
This year, we shall go into this question without equivocation. Frankly put, we shall need to start comprehensive discussions with the unions on retrenchment in accordance with the provisions of our labour laws. These negotiations will need to take into account the principle that shedding jobs in the public service does not necessarily have to translate into worsening the problem of unemployment.
For instance, retrenchment packages that include investment capital and tender obligations on the part of government can in fact help expand the job market especially in depressed rural areas. We shall, as a matter of urgency, require our public service department and provinces to work out proposals in this regard.
Jobs, jobs and jobs is the clarion call that should guide us. We do pride ourselves with the health of our economic fundamentals: the declining rate of inflation; the incentives that we introduced which have attracted over R7-billion in investments; close on to 400 projects related to Spatial Development Initiatives such as the Maputo Corridor which have attracted investments to the tune of about R77-billion; the rising graph of productivity; and increased exports.
With regard to the budget, we have introduced transparency and certainty through the Medium-term Expenditure Framework. And tax collection is improving as more people are brought into the net. We can quote many more examples, including a relatively stable exchange rate in the face of global adversity; and the hundreds of thousands of jobs created through the public works, municipal infrastructure and investment promotion programs. But the economy continues to shed too many Jobs.
This is in part because the rate of investment, particularly by ourselves as South Africans, is not enough. Within an overall increase in fixed investments of about 3%, public authorities show a massive decline in the ratio of growth of capital expenditure. Public corporations are doing much better and they need to be commended for this. The rate of growth of productive private investments has not been impressive.
As such, we should all agree that the issue is not merely one of government creating a favorable environment to attract investments. This it has done with commendable determination. What is required is a deliberate effort to increase investments: the type of investments which create jobs.
These are the things, I am told, that the various sectors in NEDLAC are addressing in preparation for the Jobs Summit. By the time of this Summit, we hope that a real partnership will have emerged among government, business and labour to tackle this critical task.
One will not be exaggerating to say that, given its impact on everything else we do as a nation, including crime prevention, reconciliation and the very survival of our democracy, the Jobs Summit is perhaps the most important event since our first democratic elections; an important launching pad for a determined national drive as we move into the 21st century.
It is quite clear that as we finalize preparations for this Summit, we cannot continue to imprison ourselves in the paradigm of large profits and only large profits as the driving force of business operations. We cannot continue to wallow in the illusion that the protection of the narrow interests of the employed is the driving force to poverty alleviation.
We must launch joint efforts towards an economy that creates jobs; towards a society that cares by helping the unfortunate in its ranks to help themselves.
Honorable Members and Delegates;
Within the context of facilitating economic growth, transfer of technology and black empowerment, we have made great progress in the program to restructure state assets. As we promised a the last opening of parliament, the previous year has seen Telkom acquire strategic partners; SunAir has been privatized; South African Airways is completing its restructuring towards acquiring a strategic partner. While the Airports Company and SAFCOL processes are taking longer than anticipated, they are on their way to completion this year.
The pace in the restructuring program is broadly in keeping with our set time frames. Where difficulties have been experienced, they represent lessons both about our past and our present.
With the Aventura Holiday Resorts for instance, a government of the people could not ignore the complex land claims that are attached to some of these resorts. With Alexkor in diamond mining, we once again learnt that much information about the net worth of many state assets has been concealed by those who ran the previous government, or they simply did not care about these assets. But we are on course to resolve the problems.
I wish once more to reiterate that, for us, the issue of restructuring of state assets is not driven by ideology. We shall privatize where necessary. But we shall also set up new state enterprises where market imperfections and failures play themselves out to undermine social programs. Such is the case with elements of the liquid fuels industry and the servicing of housing construction, which has not received the optimum support from the banking industry. Restructuring also means strengthening management of existing enterprises, a program that we have intensified.
On the issue of housing in particular it is necessary to go back to the basics.
The numbers of close on to 400 thousand subsidized houses either completed or under construction and about 700 thousand subsidies allocated are important indicators of progress. But as we indicated earlier, there is no magic in numbers as such: and the target of 1 million houses in five years, provided directly by government, may not be attained. What we need to examine closely is whether, after the delays in the launch of the housing program in 1994, we have mustered the capacity to accelerate this program. And the answer is, yes!
The pace of housing construction is accelerating. Today one thousand houses are started or completed every two-and-a-half days, and, as a result of our programs, 1,2 million South Africans have a permanent roof over their head.
In consultation with some of the banks, we have cleared hundreds of so-called redlined areas; we have ensured over 60 thousand loans at the upper end of the subsidy market; many constructors have been registered; monitoring of quality and the capacity of provinces have been enhanced.
In addition to issues of quality, questions have also been posed about the sizes of houses that are being built. Going back to the basics here means appreciating that government is focusing on the poor and most vulnerable sectors of society.
If we have to reach the widest spectrum of these citizens, with the resources available, we cannot increase the size of the subsidy. In addition to services and a plot of land that families can call their own, possibilities are left for them to exercise initiative with the resources available, and to improve the basic structure when they are in a position to do so.
Indeed, among the proudest moments of this program is the involvement of the people themselves, especially women, who through their own labour and creativity are able to achieve much more with less. In consultation with local government, we have also started to examine in greater detail the question of density, integrated development and rental accommodation.
In brief, whatever the difficulties and initial delays in the first five years, we are on course to ensure that, in the end, there shall be housing and security for all.
Honorable members and delegates will agree that significant progress has been made in transforming education, including adult basic education, from the mess it was under apartheid. Today, children starting their schooling can for the first time do so just as children - not a black piccanini or a white kleinbaas. From the self-criticism last year about the school-building projects, we are happy that provinces have started to use more of the funds set aside for this purpose.
But as in other areas, there have been moments in this sphere which bring to the public mind the enormity of the tasks that we face. Such were the matric results of last year. It is encouraging that, in typical South African style, after the brief flurry of accusations and counter-accusations, we started to focus attention on the real issues. Among these issues is the fact that the standard of the papers was somewhat higher and security of exams somewhat tighter; most inconsequential subjects taken in the past simply to fill a certificate were done away with; the marking was more rigorous and there were minimal adjustment of the marks. As such, though ironic to say, there were fewer but better passes.
This is not to detract from the fact that we have only scratched at the surface of the legacy of apartheid education. Many children still study under trees and dilapidated buildings. Many schools are hollow shells without even the most basic equipment for normal teaching. Many teachers do not have the capacity to transmit knowledge in a professional manner. And some simply do not see it as their civic duty to relocate to areas in need.
There are inexcusable and unacceptable delays in the supply of textbooks which derive from poor management and shoddy tendering deals; let alone the non-existence of malfunctioning of many school governing bodies.
Yet, when all is said and done, many schools in disadvantaged areas have shown that serious application to duty by the school authorities and the students can bring positive results. We pay tribute to these heroes.
Madame Speaker;
This spirit of community, of partnership and of hard work is required when dealing with problems of crime and corruption.
Again, in this area, the tendency often is to exaggerate and distort the real situation; to use half-truths and sensationalism to paint a picture of a situation out of control. It is understandable that unscrupulous politicians, media commentators and those who wish to question the legitimacy of the democratic process as such will conjure up crises in the heads, where in reality there are no crises.
The task of those interested in improving the country's quality of life is to examine the real situation in its complex forms, even if this may not please the prophets of doom.
That reality is that, since 1994, there has been a marked decline in virtually all serious crimes such as murder, robbery, taxi violence, car-hijacking and others. In other words, since this democratic government came into being, there has been a decline in most serious crimes. This is a result of better co-ordination among all arms of the security services: the police, the intelligence services and the defense force, as well as co-operation across Southern Africa. One such example of effective co-ordination is in the farming areas, where there is an 80% success rate in apprehending the murderers.
The National Crime Prevention Strategy has got off the ground. And as we promised last year, the law on bail and mandatory sentences for serious crimes has been passed. A Detective Academy - interestingly the very first one in the history of South Africa - has been opened to improve police's investigative capacity and skills to do their jobs. Proposals on reducing commercial entry points including closing some so-called international airports have been finalized: and we hope that we shall receive the co-operation of all affected parties, despite the formal agreements that they may have entered into with the previous government.
Among the elements which know how effective the security forces are becoming are the crime syndicates themselves. It appears that from time to time, and not seldom during crucial political moments, they will engage in dramatic acts such as robbery of cash-in-transit, syndicate turf wars and prison escapes.
But they know, better than any politician that the net is closing on them; that the intelligence services are on their heels even if it may take time to build water-tight cases against them; that wherever they may be hiding - even in the police and other state structures, in the private security companies, among prison warders and even the legal fraternity; that even if they may form a web of political forces bent on destabilizing our young democracy - they know that their days are numbered.
The same should be said about corrupt elements who see public service as an opportunity for self-enrichment. Mechanisms are in place and are being improved all the time to root them out. In this regard, I wish to thank the media for its vigilance. While there may be instances where fingers were pointed at individuals without justification, there are a good many examples where investigative journalism has helped us uncover the scoundrels - old and new - who prey on the public purse.
To find a lasting solution to all these challenges requires a community spirit among all of us, a New Patriotism which is finding root within the populace. We must build our nation into a community of citizens who appreciate their civic duty as each one of us improves our well-being. We must be ready to give back to society part of what we gain from it.
In this respect, the words of one eminent citizen who has actively joined the campaign against crime are worth repeating in this august Assembly:
""...this country, warts and all, has been good to me - it is unbelievable. It has fed me; it has clothed me; it has educated me; it has given me opportunities in the business world that were unthinkable when I was a kid in Brits. I think the very least I could do is put something back. And this is my kind of national service and I am enjoying it ...""
This is a challenge to all of us, especially those whose past privileges have afforded them skills that are in high demand in public service, to volunteer skills to help improve the lot of the nation.
Indeed, on the vexed question of crime, we could do more if each South African of integrity consciously ask themselves everyday whether they may have assisted in the commission of crime:
* as a parent who conceals the activities of a child who is taking drugs, without assisting the police to track down the suppliers;
* as a customer who co-operates in a transaction which allows you a large discount because the seller will not pay VAT;
* as a trade unionist or ordinary worker who turns a blind eye to pilfering on the shop-floor or worse still to corruption in government service;
* as a politician who stands behind individuals who break the law, in the name of challenging bodies such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission;
* as a parent or spouse who avoids asking questions when a relative is suddenly awash with money, and behaves like a fugitive from justice.
Don't many of us do this and more; and yet express bewilderment at the high rate of crime.
What this emphasizes is that we need a campaign of moral regeneration. As we reconstruct the material conditions of our existence, we must also change our way of thinking, to respect the value and result of honest work, and to treat each law of the country as our own.
This is our call to all South Africans to firm up the moral fibre of our nation. It is a call to artists and musicians and sportspeople, to religious leaders and traditional institutions, to intellectuals, to the media and to all those who should give leadership as we established new symbols and role models: all of us to join hands in a New Patriotism; not because the government says so, but because it is in our common interest to do it.
In this regard, it is encouraging that the youth of our country through the National Youth Commission have taken important steps to define a youth policy that will give all - irrespective of the skin color that is the accident of birth - a stake in our new society. Particularly heartening is the proposal for youth community service, which can be broadened to encompass most of society: be it in helping to clean streets, volunteering services in schools and so on.
Civic duty is the central purpose behind the Masakhane Campaign, whose awareness week last year was fairly successful. We shall continue this year and beyond to intensify this drive, including the mobilization of, and assistance to, Non-Governmental and Community-Based Organizations who truly have the interests of the community at heart.
Honorable Members and Delegates;
It is to promote the spirit of Masakhane that we set up the President's Award for Community Initiative. This annual award honors those who roll up their sleeves and take the initiative to uplift their conditions.
We are privileged today to have with us, as guests of the President, representatives of the nine communities that were the first Provincial Winners. Selected from some two thousand entries, they embody the unquenchable determination of South Africans to better their own lives.
We recognize the Buhlebemvelo Garden Project from KwaZulu-Natal; the Ikgodisent Sewing Project from Huhudi; the Malungeni Training and Development Centre; the Bekkersdal Flagship Project for unemployed mothers; the Dassie pre-school Centre from Oudtshoorn; the Khotsong Branch of the Homeless People's Federation; the Nkomazi Farmers Association, the Hantam Community Education Trust - and finally, the project which was yesterday announced as the National Winner of the President's Award for Community Initiative, the Mhala Development Centre in the Northern Province, set up by retrenched mineworkers working with their union and their former employer.
Our congratulations to those whom you represent, and indeed to all the 54 runners-up. May the financial prizes from government strengthen your efforts - and may your example inspire others to seek this honor in future years.
There are also countless others outside the limelight who deserve our admiration, and gratitude, such as school principal Mr Mandla Hlatshwayo of Ndwedwe in KwaZulu-Natal, who braved a raging river during torrential rains to deliver matric examination papers to his students; the security guard who risked life and limb single-handedly to hold highway robbers at bay, leading to their arrest; the many sportspeople and other citizens who make us proud to be South African.
This multifaceted effort to build our society on the basis of a new morality demands that we should be open about mistakes that we committed in the past. Such is the importance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Because these mistakes were committed by us, so will their airing in public be hurtful and at times embarrassing. But the more we know about how low we once sank, the more difficult it will be to repeat these mistakes.
At the hearings of the TRC over the past year many horrid details emerged. We cannot fail to have been moved by the remorse of some perpetrators, and the preparedness of victims to forgive. We cannot fail to have been astounded by their very modest appeals for their dignity to be restored. But this should not be surprising, for their suffering was not for pecuniary gain, but for the great prize of freedom and a better life for all.
The government has heard the appeals for urgent reparations. And we shall be ready to provide modest assistance when the details have been forwarded. As part of the multi-year budget, account will be taken of the needs, within our limited resources; and we hope that those who benefited from the suppression of others will find it within themselves to make a contribution. As the TRC moves towards finalizing its work, we shall do our best to ensure that their needs are provided for. But we know too that this will not be the end, but the beginning of the process of reconciliation.
It is quite unfortunate that some among us still refuse to co-operate with the TRC. Given that part of its task is to unmask the networks that not only violated human rights, but also formed one web with crime syndicates, the question will haunt such forces forever, why it is that they continue to conceal this information! We need to make it clear that those who cringe at the banks of the Rubicon of truth, those who served in state structures and refused to apply for amnesty, will not be assisted by the state in the face of whatever consequences accrue to them from their past.
Related to this is the danger of any political leadership and media to continue with the campaign of exploiting the fear, uncertainty and anxiety of certain communities about the transition. The clamor among some parties to outdo one another in this regard is counter-productive, to say the least. It worsens polarization and stokes the fires that have the potential of consuming all of us.
In any case, it is pointless because it will not stop change. Transformation is this government's reason for existence; and we shall not for a moment shirk our responsibility to the poor. This government is humane, and we know that the well-being of those previously denied their rights is the sure guarantee for the well-being of all.
It is for this reason that it pains me personally when I listen to some of the debates in this chamber. Always, a clear distinction emerges between those who were at the cutting edge of the struggle for freedom who strive for change; and those who implemented of benefited from oppression who seek to block transformation, in defense of a modified form of the old order.
I should take this opportunity to pay homage to the institutions charged with the task of enhancing our democracy and culture of human rights. If we say with confidence that South Africa will succeed, it is in part because we know there is a Constitutional Court, the Public Protector, the Human rights Commission, the Electoral Commission, which has started its challenging work, and the Auditor-General, all of which will assist in ensuring that what we do is not only constitutional, legal and legitimate, but that it is seen to be so by all and sundry, including the weakest among us.
A word of congratulations to the Gender Commission which has started its work to ensure that our society is true to the principles of consistent equality in everything we do. Yet this Commission and the Office on the Status of Women should not be seen as watchdogs of an alien force bent on doing wrong. Rather society as a whole should see them as part of our joint efforts as men and women, to liberate themselves from gender prejudice.
We are also encouraged by the systematic work being done regarding the position of the disabled. What matters is not merely the thousands of wheel-chairs, hearing aids and tens of thousands of cataract operations provided in the past year alone; but also ensuring that the attitude in employment practices, in discourse, in design of infrastructure and more - all these should be changed with the participation of the disabled themselves.
This year, we shall ensure the intensification of the efforts regarding multilingualism in government work, and we should thank the Pan-South African Language Board for its vigilance. Further, after extensive consultations during the course of last year, we are a step closer towards the setting up of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities.
Madame Speaker;
Our program for this year will once more seek to speed up the improvement of the lives of all, with particular emphasis on the most vulnerable and needy.
Some of the additional highlights of this program, whose detail will be announced by the various ministries during the course of next week, include:
Our commitment to meet our budget deficit targets, as we further improve the efficiency of tax collection. As the further steps we took recently indicated, we shall continue, on a case-by-case basis, to lift exchange controls as conditions for such mature. Construction starts on many Maputo Development Corridor projects; two new development initiatives in the Cape West Coast and Northern KwaZulu-Natal will be launched in the first half of the year. Work starts in the West to complete the Highway across South Africa from Maputo to Walvis Bay. The basic economy is being revolutionized.
The integrated tourism program will be launched in earnest, with the potential to create 300 thousand jobs by the turn of the century.
In the work-place, the departure from apartheid practices will be felt even more keenly as we finalize and implement the bill on employment equity. And let us hasten to add in this regard, that we shall not be discouraged by the sirens of self-interest that are being sounded in defense of privilege, and the insults that equate women, Africans, Indians, Coloureds and the disabled with a lowering of standards. As we have said before, affirmative action is corrective action. There is no other way of moving away from racial discrimination to true equality. We therefore reject campaigns which are based on fear, rumor and gossip.
Special attention this year will be paid to the further consolidation of Local Government, with its critical contribution in areas of infrastructure, job-creation, small business development and the very legitimacy of democracy. We should also take this opportunity to acknowledge local government Delegates present her, and with them celebrate the beginning of their full participation in the National Council of Provinces and Inter-Governmental Forums.
The White Paper and new legislation on local government which should be finalized this year will help streamline this sphere of government without derogating from representative and accountability. And to start meeting the requirements of the constitution in the context of poverty alleviation, over R3 billion will this year be equitably and directly allocated to this sphere of government.
As we attend to these matters, particular attention will be paid to continued dialogue with traditional leaders, so as to ensure that all of them become full and active partners in the struggle for local development.
This year also sees the launch of the new Government Communications and Information Service, which, we are certain, will contribute to the challenge to improve communication among South Africans, to afford citizens their rights to information and to air their views.
Our continuing work to reduce incidents of crime will also pay particular attention to women and child abuse, crimes which, regrettably seem to be on the increase. Special programs for the 6 metropolitan areas which account for the bulk of violent crimes are being finalized for immediate implementation. Let us once more underline to those who choose to live a life of violent crime, that as recent incidents regarding cash heists have shown, we shall, with the combined might of the security services, return fire with overwhelming fire.
This year, we launch the program that will streamline the judicial system so as to alleviate overcrowding in prisons, without creating any new dangers to society. Above all, we shall appoint the National Director of Public Prosecutions and provincial counterparts - a first in the history of our country.
Within the intelligence services, it has become even more urgent to unearth the few rotten apples who arrogantly pursue an agenda counter to transformation. To put it mildly, they are an affront to our security and our pride as a nation; they are a blight on the commendable work that these services are doing to defend democracy.
We are proud that, after a year of so of healthy and informative debate, we can now start the protracted process of re-equipping our National Defence Force. We wish to congratulate the armed forces and economic ministries which have ensured that much of this will be done without a strain on the budget, and in a way that will benefit the economy.
Our social program will be aimed at accelerating implementation and consolidation of what has been achieved within the limits of our resources. This includes:
* Ensuring that 90% of mothers and young children have access to free medical care; starting the child support grant system which will reach 3-million children by the fifth year; achieving an 85% cure rate for tuberculosis; implementing the new laws to make drugs and doctors accessible; and, in addition to the building of clinics, dedicating R100 million to the upgrading of hospitals.
* In this, the Year of Science and Technology, our programs to improve the learning environment, including the setting up of the Council on Higher Education, will be enhanced by a campaign to usher in a new and dynamic culture of scientific and technical innovation rooted in our schools, communities and enterprises.
* In the next financial year, a further 580-thousand telephones will be installed. And we aim to supply a further 1-million citizens with clean and accessible water. At the same time, it is our responsibility, as the Water Bill is finalized, to change our own water consumption culture, recognizing that this is a scarce resource that must not be squandered.
As cabinet finalizes these and other plans in the context of multi-year budgeting, we shall, as always be guided by our concern for the poor and most vulnerable sectors of society; to provide basic services, to improve the economy and job-creation, to deepen democracy and good governance and to improve the safety and security of all.
I should also announce that, as a pro-active measure to further improve good governance and in accordance with the Constitution, the President's Office will this year start drafting legislation on ethics in government, including a statutory Code of Conduct applying to members of the executive at national and provincial levels.
Honorable Members and Delegates;
In our efforts, we draw inspiration from countries that have to address problems to varying degrees similar to ours.
In our relationship with the world, we can now confidently say that South Africa has found her niche as an independent participant in world affairs.
Our starting point in these relations is the obvious: That South Africa is an African country. Thus we draw pride from the fact of increased trade with Africa reflected in a 70% increase in exports and 60% in imports since 1995. We shall continue to expand these relations and close co-operation with our sister African nations bilaterally and through the OAU, within the context of Africa's renaissance. We are grateful that African nations have afforded us the opportunity to make our humble contribution to the resolution of problems and reconstruction in places like the now Democratic Republic of Congo, the Great Lakes Region and the Sudan.
During the course of this year, we shall host Africa Telecom, to work out strategies and plans for the continent to become part of the communications highway.
Within SADC, we were honored to take collective leadership of the process towards a Free Trade Area. The matters to be resolved on this course are complex and, as to be expected, there is much individual self-interest. But the will and determination are there, including the difficult question of ensuring that the democratic gains that have been made over the past few years are not reversed.
As an active and respected part of the developing world, we shall in August host the Summit of leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement. As such we shall be afforded the opportunity to play a leadership role as these countries, in their own terms, define the nature and direction of globalization. All of us in these countries are concerned about the widening gap between the rich and the poor both within and among nations. But we also recognize the challenge to ensure that our own co-operation helps to define the new world order.
As a country, we are making strides in this direction: as shown by the fact that today, Asia is our second largest trading partner after Europe; and we are starting to exploit the huge potential that exists with regard to Latin America. This year we started a strategic relationship with the People's Republic of China, the biggest nation on earth. The launch last year of the Indian Ocean Rim Association is a great step that will re-establish, in the new age, strong relations that date back to pre-colonial days. At the same time, we have intensified dialogue with the North about a common human agenda as we enter the millennium.
In such dialogue, pertinent questions about the structure of the United Nations and its agencies, as well as the issues of the international financial system, the debt crisis and world trade, are on the agenda. There is world consensus that solutions need to be found to the causes and rampant effects of stock market crashes that can beggar even those economies which have got their fundamentals in place.
It is encouraging that the Commonwealth of Nations, a body-straddling the North-South divide, and whose summit we attended last year, put high on the agenda the issue of economic development. Again, as a reflection of the place we occupy in international relations, this body decided to hold its 1999 summit in South Africa.
Our relations with North American countries, Europe and Japan have grown from strength to strength. We value these relations with our main trading partners and sources of investment and aid. More particularly, we have now reached the point at which negotiations with the European Union on free trade should soon reach finality.
We shall continue to make our humble contribution to the search for peace and the humane conduct of international relations. Our condition on these issues, including the campaign for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines and nuclear disarmament, derives from our own experience about what humanity should not do to itself.
Ahead of any other country, South Africa destroyed its stockpile of over 200 thousand land-mines in a record of 5 months. The severed limbs of children, women and men in our neighboring countries are a loud warning to us that, never again should our country be a source of destabilization. As such, we shall support the stern action taken by countries whose peace is disturbed by any South Africans.
We are driven by this desire for peace when we urge for the resumption of Middle East peace talks on the basis of the Oslo Agreements. We are driven by what we believe are the long-term interests of the Palestinian and Jewish communities when we condemn prevarication and provocation by those who calculate that they can use might to prevent right. We condemn without equivocation violence by any party, for it feeds animosity rather than encourages reconciliation.
In the same spirit, we call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara and East Timor, and we shall do our best to assist where we can.
Madame Speaker;
Wherever we go internationally, we are always moved by the appreciation of the world for our efforts in resolving problems that seemed intractable.
These international forces are always willing to assist in our exciting transition. But they recognize that, in the final analysis, our success will depend on our own efforts. They appreciate and have confidence in our economic environment, and equally, they expect the same among South Africans themselves.
They respect our nation because they know we are contributing to the collective efforts of humankind redefining itself and reclaiming its humanity as we move into the new millennium.
This, our program for 1998, is a humble contribution to the quest for a better world. As always, we are encouraged, first and foremost, by the fact that South Africans are ready; and they have rolled up their sleeves to build a society that cares.
These millions of South Africans are joining hands to sustain their democratic achievement; and they will protect it like the apple of their eye. They are filled with hope about the bright future that beckons. They shall not be distracted by the noise of a falling tree amidst the dignified silence of a new future starting to blossom; because they know that:
The foundation has been laid; and the building has begun!",Opening of Parliament,1998/2/6,SA Government
10,Nelson Mandela,"Madame Speaker;
Honourable Members;
Distinguished guests;
Ladies and gentlemen:

It was to be expected that this year's debate on the State of the Nation Address should be especially enthusiastic.

This being the last session of the first democratic Parliament, we naturally cast our mind's eye back on the whole short life of our democracy. And in doing so, it was all too natural for us to appreciate the depth of the abyss from which, as a nation, we had retreated. Five years ago, the sense of our common belonging, our shared destiny, focused the mind. And together we were able to find solutions to problems that seemed defiant of resolution. This is South Africa's achievement. It is a victory of South Africans of every shade of color and every language, who have remained steadfast to the goal of bettering the lives of all South Africans, of nation-building and reconciliation. In whatever we do, we should defend it with all the might in our power.

This achievement enjoys the respect and admiration of the world at large. Humanity wants us to succeed. Able as they are to observe from near and judge from afar, they are better able to appreciate the contribution we are making to the birth of a new world order. We must live up to that expectation.

That, I believe, Madame Speaker, is the premise from which we should proceed in assessing the successes, the difficulties and the challenges we face in the coming months and years. We are a democracy - young and fledgling, but one which can boast of firm institutions and a culture that no force can take from the people of South Africa.

Even though at times we may wittingly or unwittingly pronounce ourselves in a manner that reflects concern about interests of a narrow constituency, the fact is that we know, and should know, that none of us can be secure if the rest of society is in dire need of basic amenities of life.

Of course, as the tenor of the last two days of debate made clear, members are not unmindful of the looming election. The time has come to seek a renewed mandate from the people. And, in the final analysis, it is the people who will judge the performance of each one of our organizations.

They will be right to pose the question whether we sought to build or to destroy. They will demand of us an answer to the question whether we bring them hope about a future that we should build together; or whether we seek to pull them into the mire of hatred, despair and a cynical longing for a past that shall never return.

When they do so, they will be challenging us to become leaders; not armchair critics or sirens of an apocalypse that exists only in the mind. They will be demanding practical solutions to practical problems.

It was thus remarkable, Honourable Members, how far we seemed to be in agreement on what we have achieved as a nation.

More importantly, all sides of the House were at one, that outstanding work had been done in these past four-and-half years to improve the quality of life of especially the poor. That virtually all parties in this national parliament now put a high premium on issues such as water supply, electricity, telephones, housing, job-creation, clinics, education and free medical care, demonstrates a critical awareness of what should be the priorities of this nation, if the hope of a better life for all has to become reality.

Of course it is in the nature of politics that even where the tremendous successes are clear for all to see, the acknowledgement thereof is at times begrudging. This is understandable.

Yet we should all be careful not to turn concern for difficulties into a death-wish. I refer here to the instance of crime. A number of Honourable Members referred to the issue of statistics that have been cited regarding reduction, stabilization or regrettably an increase in a number of serious categories of crime.

We do agree that the method and analysis of these statistics need to be continually improved. This is not merely for purposes of parading them when it suits a political agenda; but it should form part of a professional drive to employ strategies that will be most effective against criminals.

But the point is that we need to avoid creating the perception that we only trust statistics when they suit us. When the graph points in the direction of a deterioration, we then shout from rooftops about the failures of government. When the opposite is the case, only then do we call for a professional auditing of these statistics. This approach to a common national problem borders on the perverse.

We wish to reiterate that the level of crime, especially violent crime is much too high. It is unacceptable. Communities are perfectly right to complain that not enough is being done.

If they do so because they cannot as yet feel the steady improvements in investigations, in dealing with corruption, in smashing the syndicates that are behind drug-trafficking, robberies and car-hijacking, and in introducing the most advanced techniques of detection and prosecution, we have the responsibility to patiently explain that there is hope. If communities show impatience because the laws that are meant to narrow the space for criminals have not as yet made a visible impact; if they express disquiet because the criminal justice system is not yet as efficient as we want it to be, it behoves us as leaders to demonstrate that there is hope.

As a people, we dealt with a state that pronounced itself invincible; and we are not about to throw up our hands in despair in the face of robbers and gangsters. More than anyone else, these criminals know that the battle-lines are drawn. Their days are numbered.

Madame Speaker;

These improvements in the area of crime-reduction and prevention, revolve around the fundamental question of changing the instruments that this nation requires to deal with the problems we have inherited. For instance, that the detectives from the new academy are starting to make their mark on dealing with major crimes is thanks to the new training, new selection and deployment policies, new motivation and improving morale.

The progress that we have started to make in all sectors of government will not be sustainable, if we do not consistently and systematically change the composition and ethos of the public service. What this requires is training, development and consistent application of new rules, better management, a new cadreship and performance-based assessment of work done.

We therefore make no apologies, if anyone seeks out skilled cadres dedicated to the new order to interest themselves in, and avail themselves to, positions in all sectors of the public service. It is to the benefit of change that we should not allow one sector of government to benefit from an abundance of skills at the expense of others. As I indicated in the opening address, this is a matter that all parties should pay attention to in respect of local government, a sphere where all of us, in various capacities, interact directly with the population.

Naturally, where such positions belong in the arena of non-partisan public institutions, it is matter of law and democratic ethics that the processes should be conducted in a transparent manner through the normal ""competitive"" channels dictated to by the rules.

This is neither cronyism nor the expression of a so-called one-party state. It is a necessary commitment to transforming not only the people's condition of life, but also the instruments that will make that change possible.

It is one thing to decry lack of a public service ethos and a selfishness that breeds corruption; and it is another to take steps to find skilled personnel with a commitment to the needs of the people.

It is one thing to pronounce a commitment to a representative public service; and another to condemn the selection of blacks, the disabled and women - both black and white - into managerial positions. 

And dare we remind ourselves that those of us who went into the executive were astounded at the absence not only of these groups, but also of white men who did not come from the then ""correct ethnic group"". We have set out to change all this. And by doing so, we believe we have made South Africa the richer - with our society benefiting from the skills base that the whole nation offers.

If this is cronyism, we proudly plead guilty.

We do appreciate vigilance on the part of the Opposition and the media regarding deployment of individuals into positions of authority. We have never pronounced ourselves super-human; and temptation may creep in from time to time to select those we know, who are closest to us.

Yet we shall always reject with the contempt it deserves, any attempt to haunt men and women of integrity and requisite training and experience from jobs they deserve simply because, by accident of birth or the whim of life history, they are related to one or other person in a position of authority. What is even most astounding is that those whose policies targeted these individuals for persecution, quite often on the basis of such links - and those who quietly acquiesced in this persecution - are today the first glibly to raise their voices on this matter. This new campaign of discrimination we shall not bow to, no matter how powerful the forces who combine to wage it.

Honourable Members;

Transformation also includes reconciliation and creating a nation united in the rich diversity of communities previously forced apart.

If we think back ten years, to when those prison letters were written and when we were mired in conflict, we can only marvel at how far we have come in a short time. We have risen above historical differences to reach out to one another and build a new united nation.

The dismantling of apartheid is liberating us all, oppressor and oppressed alike, disadvantaged and privileged, to be the people we really are. I have observed before that when I travel around this country and see how people from every background are working together, I realize how little I knew my country before.

I think of meetings I have attended of Afrikaans people, in the business sector; universities; farmers; ordinary residents of towns and cities; or the NGK service last Sunday to which a member referred during the debate.

Always one finds people who respond to a message of hope, people who regard the future in a positive light because they are working to create it. Nor do they seek special treatment; but rather to be equal and valued participants in building this country.

The same can be said of all those who are said to belong to minorities. Those who appoint themselves to speak for them and who offer a message of despair; and who see the ""race-card"" in every step to dismantle past discrimination, are lagging far behind those they claim to lead.

We do appreciate the concern communities may have for the flourishing of their language, culture and religion. That is why the government chose to observe Heritage Day last year as an opportunity to mobilize support and generate plans for the establishment of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities. That process will continue.

Insofar as the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is concerned, I wish to underline that reconciliation and healing are about eradicating apartheid's legacy. And this goes beyond the capacity of government on its own. Proposals on reparations to communities and the nation as a whole, necessarily have to include provision for symbolic reparations to individuals, to the extent that the nation can afford.

Organizations and individuals with resources and skills that were acquired because they occupied privileged positions in the past, can make a special contribution to reparation through upliftment of disadvantaged communities.

Madame Speaker;

It is a combination of all these positive developments, including the determination of South Africans to deal with difficult areas, which reinforces our conviction that there is hope.

As if to confirm that South Africans in various sectors of society are far ahead of some of us, such organizations as the favor Handelsinstituut, Business Against Crime, and the trade union movement, have all responded to the State of the Nation Address by pledging to join with the rest of society and government to find practical solutions to problems facing the country. Such is the power of partnership that we referred to and shall tirelessly work to consolidate.

As if to confirm that they do not belong to the detachment of those who sit on their hands, many sectors have resolved to join hands to work for the moral regeneration of our society, its ""RDP of the soul"".

As if to assist all of us in the work that we should do among our constituents, many sectors of society have come out in favor of a society that exercises its freedoms, but also appreciates its responsibilities. Such is our call for discipline.

As we mobilize to meet these challenges, we shall do so filled with hope because we know that South Africa has a democratic government that has got the interests of the people at heart.

Yes, we do appreciate criticism. But real leaders are emerging, who are able to see those issues that unite the country; leaders who have a sense of responsibility to ensure that, at the end of each debate, we emerge more united than before.

This government has started to meet the interests of the people; and it will continue to do so even faster. This government has worked for peace among South Africans, and it will continue to consolidate that achievement. While apartheid divided South Africans into conflicting groups, this government unites. It is this government that has started to bring reconciliation to South Africa; and it will soldier on towards that objective.

The fact that South Africa is in many respects the admiration of the world is not a matter of accident. It is a result of the hard work of men and women who sacrificed so our country could join humanity in the search for a better world.

And with such a leadership, with such organized formations determined to build partnerships for change, what more can we say, but that there is hope for South Africa! All we need to do together is to turn this hope into reality.",Closing debate on State of the Nation Address,1999/2/10,SA Government
